## 歌词

<div>
There's something about her<br><br>
You know it's the way that she carries herself<br><br>
She's just so bad<br><br>
Ooh I don't know<br><br>
Her style her mind<br><br>
Compares to nothing on this Earth<br><br>
She's not the kind to share<br><br>
Only God knows what she's worth<br><br>
I got to show her that I want her<br><br>
I recognize that she is bad<br><br>
If I can't have her then I'll go crazy<br><br>
Spending all my time just chasing<br><br>
I got to show her that I want her<br><br>
I recognize that she is bad<br><br>
If I can't have her then I'll go crazy<br><br>
Spending all my time just chasing<br><br>
Her eyes her smile<br><br>
Her skin her smell her hair<br><br>
（She's incredible baby ooh）<br><br>
Her walk her talk<br><br>
Her way her shadow fell （ ）<br><br>
There she goes （Oh baby）<br><br>
I hope to find her there<br><br>
Gotta make some eye contact<br><br>
She's not the kind to stare<br><br>
Move quick or lose her fast<br><br>
I got to show her that I want her<br><br>
I recognize that she is bad<br><br>
If I can't have her then I'll go crazy<br><br>
Spending all my time just chasing<br><br>
I got to show her that I want her<br><br>
I recognize that she is bad<br><br>
If I can't have her then I'll go crazy<br><br>
Spending all my time just chasing<br><br>
Her eyes her smile<br><br>
Her skin her smell her hair<br><br>
（Ooh baby she's incredible baby ooh）<br><br>
Her walk her talk<br><br>
Her way her shadow fell （ ）<br><br>
There she goes （There she goes）<br><br>
Her eyes her smile<br><br>
Her skin her smell her hair<br><br>
（You're incredible baby）<br><br>
Her walk her talk<br><br>
Her way her shadow fell （ ）<br><br>
There she goes<br><br>
（There she goes come on）<br><br>
Spending all my time watching that girl go （Dance）<br><br>
Gotta love her when she moves （Get down girl）<br><br>
Spending all my time watching that girl go （Dance）<br><br>
Gotta love her when she moves<br><br>
Her eyes her smile<br><br>
Her skin her smell her hair<br><br>
（She's incredible）<br><br>
Her walk her talk<br><br>
Her way her shadow fell （ ）<br><br>
There she goes （Ooh there she goes baby）<br><br>
Her eyes her smile<br><br>
Her skin her smell her hair （Ooh baby you're incredible baby）<br><br>
Her walk her talk<br><br>
Her way her shadow fell （ ）<br><br>
There she goes （There she goes baby）<br><br>
Her eyes her smile<br><br>
Her skin her smell her hair<br><br>
（Ooh baby she's incredible baby ooh）<br><br>
Her walk her talk<br><br>
Her way her shadow fell （ ）<br><br>
There she goes （There she goes）<br><br>
Her eyes her smile<br><br>
Her skin her smell her hair （Oh）<br><br>
Her walk her talk<br><br>
Her way her shadow fell （ ）<br><br>
There she goes （There she goes）<br><br>
I got to show her that I want her<br><br>
I recognize that she is bad<br><br>
If I can't have her then I'll go crazy<br><br>
Spending all my time just chasing<br><br>
Spending all my time watching that girl go （Dance）<br><br>
Gotta love her when she moves （Get down girl）<br><br>
Spending all my time watching that girl go （Dance）<br><br>
Gotta love her when she moves
