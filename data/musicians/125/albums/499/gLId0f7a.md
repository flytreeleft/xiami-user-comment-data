Jay-Z - Hard Knock Life(VOL.2)<br><br>
Check the bassline out' uh-huh<br><br>
Jigga (bounce wit it)' uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh' yeahh<br><br>
Let it bump though<br><br>
It's the hard knock life (uh-huh) for us<br><br>
It's the hard knock life' for us!!<br><br>
Steada treated' we get tricked<br><br>
Steada kisses' we get kicked<br><br>
It's the hard knock life!!<br><br>
From standin on the corners boppin<br><br>
To drivin some of the hottest cars New York has ever seen<br><br>
For droppin some of the hottest verses rap has ever heard<br><br>
From the dope spot' with the smoke Glock<br><br>
Fleein the murder scene' you know me well<br><br>
From nightmares of a lonely cell' my only hell<br><br>
But since when y'all niggaz know me to fail? Fuck naw<br><br>
Where all my niggaz with the rubber grips' bust shots<br><br>
And if you with me mom I rub on your tits' and what-not<br><br>
I'm from the school of the hard knocks' we must not<br><br>
Let outsiders violate our blocks' and my plot<br><br>
Let's stick up the world and split it fifty/fifty' uh-huh<br><br>
Let's take the dough and stay real jiggy' uh-huh<br><br>
And sip the Cris' and get pissy-pissy<br><br>
Flow infinitely like the memory of my nigga Biggie' baby!<br><br>
You know it's hell when I come through<br><br>
The life and times of Shawn Carter<br><br>
Nigga Volume 2' y'all niggaz get ready<br><br>
It's the hard knock life' for us<br><br>
It's the hard knock life' for us!!<br><br>
Steada treated' we get tricked<br><br>
Steada kisses' we get kicked<br><br>
It's the hard knock life!!<br><br>
I flow for those 'dro'ed out; all my niggaz<br><br>
Locked down in the ten by fo'' controllin the house<br><br>
We live in hard knocks' we don't take over we borrow blocks<br><br>
Burn em down and you can have it back daddy' I'd rather that<br><br>
I flow for chicks wishin' they ain't have to strip to pay tuition<br><br>
I see you vision mama' I put my money on the longshots<br><br>
All my ballers that's born to clock<br><br>
Now I'ma be on top whether I perform or not<br><br>
I went from lukewarm to hot; sleepin on futons and cots<br><br>
To King Size' dream machines' the green fives<br><br>
I've seen pies let the thing between my eyes analyze life's ills<br><br>
Then I put it down type braile<br><br>
I'm tight grill with the phony' rappers y'all might feel we homies<br><br>
I'm like still' y'all don't know me' shit!<br><br>
I'm tight grill when my situation ain't improvin<br><br>
I'm tryin to murder everything movin' feel me?!<br><br>
It's the hard knock life' for us<br><br>
It's the hard knock life' for us!!<br><br>
Steada treated' we get tricked<br><br>
Steada kisses' we get kicked<br><br>
It's the hard knock life' for us<br><br>
It's the hard knock life' for us!!<br><br>
Steada treated' we get tricked<br><br>
Steada kisses' we get kicked<br><br>
It's the hard knock life!!<br><br>
I don't how to sleep' I gotta eat' stay on my toes<br><br>
Gotta a lot of beef' so logically' I prey on my foes<br><br>
Hustling's still inside of me' and as far as progress<br><br>
You'd be hard-pressed' to find another rapper hot as me<br><br>
I gave you prophecy on my first joint' and y'all lamed out<br><br>
Didn't really appreciate it' til the second one came out<br><br>
So I stretched the game out' X'ed your name out<br><br>
Put Jigga on top' and drop albums non-stop for ya' nigguh!<br><br>
It's the hard knock life' for us<br><br>
It's the hard knock life' for us!!<br><br>
Steada treated' we get tricked<br><br>
Steada kisses' we get kicked<br><br>
It's the hard knock life' for us<br><br>
It's the hard knock life' for us!!<br><br>
Steada treated' we get tricked<br><br>
Steada kisses' we get kicked<br><br>
It's the hard knock life!!<br><br>
.. It's the hard knock life!!<br><br>
.. It's the hard knock life!!
