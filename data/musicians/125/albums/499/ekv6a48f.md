He Wasn't Man Enough / Toni Braxton 他不是个男人 / 唐妮布蕾斯顿<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
Darkchild, oh yeah<br><br>
Toni Braxton, oh<br><br>
Ha-ha, uh-huh<br><br>
Yeah, uh, uh<br><br>
Darkchild yeah<br><br>
<br><br>
Who do you think I am?<br><br>
Don't you know that he was my man?<br><br>
But I chose to let him go<br><br>
So why do you act like I still care about him?<br><br>
Looking at me like I'm hurt<br><br>
When I'm the one who said I didn't want it to work<br><br>
Don't you forget I had him first?<br><br>
<br><br>
Whatcha' thinking?<br><br>
Stop blaming me<br><br>
He wasn't man enough for me<br><br>
If you don't know now, here's your chance<br><br>
I've already had your man<br><br>
Do you wonder just where he's been, yeah<br><br>
And I'd be worried about him<br><br>
Now it's time you know the truth<br><br>
I think he's just the man for you<br><br>
<br><br>
What are you thinking<br><br>
Do you know about us back then<br><br>
Do you know I dumped your husband<br><br>
Girlfriend,<br><br>
I'm not thinking 'bout him<br><br>
But you married him<br><br>
Do you know I made him leave<br><br>
Do you know he begged to stay, with me<br><br>
He wasn't man enough for me<br><br>
<br><br>
Didn't he tell you the truth<br><br>
If not, then why don't you ask him<br><br>
And maybe you could be more into him<br><br>
Instead of worrying 'bout me<br><br>
And hopefully, you won't find<br><br>
All of the reasons why his love didn't count<br><br>
And why we couldn't work it out<br><br>
<br><br>
Whatcha' thinking?<br><br>
Stop blaming me<br><br>
He wasn't man enough for me<br><br>
If you don't know now, here's your chance<br><br>
I've already had your man<br><br>
Do you wonder just where he's been, yeah<br><br>
And I'd be worried about him<br><br>
Now it's time you know the truth<br><br>
I think he's just the man for you<br><br>
<br><br>
What are you thinking<br><br>
Do you know about us back then<br><br>
Do you know I dumped your husband<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
Girlfriend,<br><br>
I'm not thinking 'bout him<br><br>
But you married him<br><br>
Do you know I made him leave<br><br>
Do you know he begged to stay, with me<br><br>
He wasn't man enough for me<br><br>
<br><br>
What are you thinking<br><br>
Do you know about us back then<br><br>
Do you know I dumped your husband<br><br>
Girlfriend,<br><br>
I'm not thinking 'bout him<br><br>
But you married him<br><br>
Do you know I made him leave<br><br>
Do you know he begged to stay, with me<br><br>
He wasn't man enough for me<br><br>
<br><br>
So many reasons why our love is through<br><br>
What makes you think he'll be good to you<br><br>
It makes no sense<br><br>
'Cause he will never change<br><br>
Girl you better recognize the game<br><br>
<br><br>
What are you thinking<br><br>
Do you know about us back then<br><br>
Do you know I dumped your husband<br><br>
Girlfriend,<br><br>
I'm not thinking 'bout him<br><br>
But you married him<br><br>
Do you know I made him leave<br><br>
Do you know he begged to stay, with me<br><br>
He wasn't man enough for me<br><br>
<br><br>
What are you thinking<br><br>
Do you know about us back then<br><br>
Do you know I dumped your husband<br><br>
Girlfriend,<br><br>
I'm not thinking 'bout him<br><br>
But you married him<br><br>
Do you know I made him leave<br><br>
Do you know he begged to stay, with me<br><br>
He wasn't man enough for me<br><br>
<br><br>
What are you thinking<br><br>
Do you know about us back then<br><br>
Do you know I dumped your husband<br><br>
Girlfriend,<br><br>
I'm not thinking 'bout him<br><br>
But you married him<br><br>
Do you know I made him leave<br><br>
Do you know he begged to stay, with me<br><br>
He wasn't man enough for me
