## 歌词

<div>
Ooh mmmn<br><br>
In the beginning it was compliments everyday<br><br>
You said when we first started out<br><br>
I would go out my way<br><br>
But one day you claimed I don't appreciate you<br><br>
And I don't know how to treat you<br><br>
We don't do the same things we did no more<br><br>
What I don't really understand is<br><br>
How could you offend take that<br><br>
I would be that take a man who take control of you like that<br><br>
Don't you know better than that<br><br>
Can't believe your're acting like that<br><br>
After all I've did for you you've come to me like that<br><br>
Every time we take one step forward<br><br>
You take 2 steps back<br><br>
Everytime it's right you bring left back oh oh<br><br>
Girl you really oughta think about it<br><br>
Cuz there's really no doubt about it<br><br>
You know I've been there for you and that's the truth<br><br>
Every time we take one step forward<br><br>
You take 2 steps back<br><br>
Everytime it's right you bring left back oh oh<br><br>
Girl you really oughta think about it<br><br>
Cuz there's really no doubt about it<br><br>
You know I've been there for you and that's the truth<br><br>
Don't understand where you're coming from<br><br>
Cuz love's sacrifice<br><br>
Sometimes I feel like what you did now<br><br>
Don't wanna go with this for life<br><br>
You claimed I no longer wanna rub you<br><br>
And I do not wanna touch you<br><br>
We don't play the little games we did before<br><br>
Did you ever take the time to think that maybe<br><br>
I was just going through things<br><br>
Just because you're a woman you're not the only one<br><br>
Who's been missing<br><br>
What about you rubbing on my shoulder<br><br>
Telling me I love you<br><br>
You don't do the things you used to do no more<br><br>
Every time we take one step forward<br><br>
You take 2 steps back<br><br>
Everytime it's right you bring left back oh oh<br><br>
Girl you really oughta think about it<br><br>
Cuz there's really no doubt about it<br><br>
You know I've been there for you and that's the truth<br><br>
Don't understand where you're coming from<br><br>
Every time we take one step forward<br><br>
You take 2 steps back<br><br>
Everytime it's right you bring left back oh oh<br><br>
Girl you really oughta think about it<br><br>
Cuz there's really no doubt about it<br><br>
You know I've been there for you and that's the truth<br><br>
Remember it wasn't that long ago<br><br>
Paris and monaco<br><br>
Don't forget last tuesday night<br><br>
Making love with candlelight<br><br>
Remember how about those many times<br><br>
How about those many times<br><br>
Make sure you'd never know<br><br>
Couldn't let it show a sign<br><br>
Want you to trust me<br><br>
Tell me why the hell can't you see<br><br>
That you're only gonna mess it up<br><br>
You've done enough you gotta stop<br><br>
You're gonna lose what's good for you<br><br>
That's the last thing you wanna do<br><br>
There won't be another like me<br><br>
Every time we take one step forward<br><br>
You take 2 steps back<br><br>
Everytime it's right you bring left back oh oh<br><br>
Girl you really oughta think about it<br><br>
Cuz there's really no doubt about it<br><br>
You know I've been there for you and that's the truth<br><br>
Every time we take one step forward<br><br>
You take 2 steps back<br><br>
Everytime it's right you bring left back oh oh<br><br>
Girl you really oughta think about it<br><br>
Cuz there's really no doubt about it<br><br>
You know I've been there for you and that's the truth<br><br>
Every time we take one step forward<br><br>
You take 2 steps back<br><br>
Everytime it's right you bring left back oh oh<br><br>
Girl you really oughta think about it<br><br>
Cuz there's really no doubt about it<br><br>
You know I've been there for you and that's the truth<br><br>
Every time we take one step forward<br><br>
You take 2 steps back<br><br>
Everytime it's right you bring left back oh oh<br><br>
Girl you really oughta think about it<br><br>
Cuz there's really no doubt about it<br><br>
You know I've been there for you and that's the truth<br><br>
Hey that's the truth in the beginning<br><br>
It was all good everything yea<br><br>
Everything
