Deborah Cox - Absolutely Not<br><br>
Always waitin' for someone<br><br>
To make me happy pick me up<br><br>
I realize that someone is me<br><br>
What you call life that ain't livin'<br><br>
Bless the child that's got his own<br><br>
It's my season now I stand alone<br><br>
Just thought that I would let you know<br><br>
Some things you just can't control<br><br>
Should I wear my hair in a ponytail <br><br>
Should I dress myself up in chanel <br><br>
Do I measure me by what you think <br><br>
Absolutely not absolutely not<br><br>
If I go to work in a mini-skirt<br><br>
Am I givin' you the right to flirt <br><br>
I won't compromise my point of view<br><br>
Absolutely not absolutely not<br><br>
Told myself I won't complain<br><br>
But some things have got to change<br><br>
Not gon' be a victim of<br><br>
All your social push and shove<br><br>
Right or wrong you judge the same<br><br>
My picture never fit your frame<br><br>
What you thought you'll never know<br><br>
You can't see me with your mind closed<br><br>
Should I wear my hair in a ponytail <br><br>
Should I dress myself up in chanel <br><br>
Do I measure me by what you think <br><br>
Absolutely not absolutely not<br><br>
If I go to work in a mini-skirt<br><br>
Am I givin' you the right to flirt <br><br>
I won't compromise my point of view<br><br>
Absolutely not<br><br>
Now I see life means more to me<br><br>
More than fancy clothes<br><br>
More than you'll ever know<br><br>
All the ugly words that I heard you say<br><br>
Made me stronger everyday<br><br>
Now I live my life for me<br><br>
Oh ooh<br><br>
If I go to work in a mini-skirt<br><br>
Am I givin' you the right to flirt <br><br>
I won't compromise my point of view<br><br>
Absolutely not absolutely not<br><br>
Should I wear my hair in a ponytail <br><br>
Should I dress myself up in chanel <br><br>
Do I measure me by what you think <br><br>
Absolutely not absolutely not<br><br>
If I go to work in a mini-skirt<br><br>
Am I givin' you the right to flirt <br><br>
I won't compromise my point of view<br><br>
Absolutely not absolutely not<br><br>
Should I wear my hair in a ponytail <br><br>
Should I dress myself up in chanel <br><br>
Do I measure me by what you think <br><br>
Absolutely not<br><br>
All my ladies say<br><br>
Oh ooh<br><br>
Woah oh ooh<br><br>
All my people say<br><br>
Oh ooh<br><br>
Woah oh ooh<br><br>
All my ladies say<br><br>
Oh ooh<br><br>
Woah oh ooh<br><br>
Everybody says<br><br>
Oh ooh<br><br>
Woah oh ooh<br><br>
Absolutely not
