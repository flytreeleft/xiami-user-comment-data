U Know What's Up - Donell Jones<br><br>
Ooh, say what, say what, say what<br><br>
Ooh, girl u know what's up<br><br>
Ooh, say what, say what, say what<br><br>
Ooh, girl u know what's up<br><br>
Me and my niggas be rollin'<br><br>
Schemin' on u and your homies<br><br>
The very first day of summer<br><br>
All chromed out in a Hummer, babe<br><br>
Hit the park and parlay<br><br>
Hopin' that u walk this way<br><br>
Do u and your girls wanna ride<br><br>
Play all day and puff on the la<br><br>
Ooh, say what, say what, say what<br><br>
Ooh, girl u know what's up<br><br>
Ooh, say what, say what, say what<br><br>
Ooh, girl u know what's up<br><br>
I'm diggin' u and I'm feelin' u<br><br>
U know what's up<br><br>
Said i'm diggin' u and I'm wantin' u<br><br>
So tell me what's up<br><br>
Peep her thighs and I'm zonin'<br><br>
Right around two in the mornin'<br><br>
Lookin' fly with a sundress on<br><br>
Think I feel a bone comin on<br><br>
Girl u got it wide open<br><br>
Want all day and in hopin'<br><br>
Baby don't front<br><br>
Back seat Jeep, u know what I want<br><br>
Ooh, say what, say what, say what<br><br>
Ooh, girl u know what's up<br><br>
Ooh, say what, say what, say what<br><br>
Ooh, girl u know what's up<br><br>
I'm diggin' u and I'm feelin' u<br><br>
U know what's up<br><br>
Said i'm diggin' u and I'm wantin' u<br><br>
So tell me what's up<br><br>
So baby tell me what's up<br><br>
Can we ascend to higher heights<br><br>
And when the path gets rough<br><br>
We can give in to brighter nights<br><br>
Breathe with peace, expand by leaps<br><br>
Sow to reap our souls to keep<br><br>
The passions deep and filled with heat<br><br>
Living this life on the hustle<br><br>
I barely get enough time<br><br>
U know me for the Platinum<br><br>
How I stack them and shine<br><br>
U see a lot of contenders<br><br>
They try to end up in my world<br><br>
A reputation known as the untouchable girl<br><br>
I'm movin' on and now I'm tryin'<br><br>
To make a change in my ways<br><br>
Be the best that I can be<br><br>
To last me all of my days<br><br>
Now we can blaze pathways<br><br>
Or just take our time<br><br>
Better hollar if you hear me<br><br>
Cuz Left-Eye gonna shine<br><br>
My eyes don't lie see how<br><br>
They glisten when you pass me by<br><br>
U and I don't need permission to be unified<br><br>
Surely I done seen and heard of many places<br><br>
Then I traveled around the world, seen many faces<br><br>
Don't let another one get near me if you wanna be true<br><br>
And show me that nobody else can do it better than you<br><br>
So if you serious, I'm curious to see what you got<br><br>
My love is furious, cuz I believe in blowin' up spots<br><br>
I'm diggin' u and I'm feelin' u<br><br>
U know what's up<br><br>
Said i'm diggin' u and I'm wantin' u<br><br>
So tell me what's up<br><br>
I'm diggin' u and I'm feelin' u<br><br>
U know what's up<br><br>
Said i'm diggin' u and I'm wantin' u<br><br>
So tell me what's up
