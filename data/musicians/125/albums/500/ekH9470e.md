What If<br><br>
Babyface<br><br>
RelaX produced lyrics<br><br>
I ran into a friend of yours the other day<br><br>
And I asked her how you've been<br><br>
She said my girl is fine Just bought a house<br><br>
Got a job real good man<br><br>
I told her I was glad for you that's wonderful<br><br>
But does she ever ask about me<br><br>
She said she's happy with her life right now<br><br>
Let her go let her be<br><br>
And I told myself I would<br><br>
But something in my heart just would not let you go<br><br>
I just wanna know<br><br>
What if we were wrong about each other<br><br>
What if you were really meant for me<br><br>
What if we were suppose to be together<br><br>
Would that not mean anything<br><br>
What if that was suppose to be my house that you go home to every day<br><br>
How can you be sure that things are better<br><br>
If you can't be sure your heart ain't still here with me<br><br>
Still wanting me<br><br>
Your friend asked me if they're someone special<br><br>
In my life that I was seeing<br><br>
I told her there was no one in particular<br><br>
There's just I myself and me<br><br>
I told her that I dream of you quite often<br><br>
She just cut her eyes at me<br><br>
She said you got on you're very happy<br><br>
So just stop your meddling<br><br>
I told her that I won't<br><br>
I said that things were cool But I guess I was wrong<br><br>
I still can't move on<br><br>
What if we were wrong about each other<br><br>
What if you were really meant for me<br><br>
What if we were suppose to be together<br><br>
Would that not mean anything<br><br>
What if that was suppose to be my house that you go home to every day<br><br>
How can you be sure that things are better<br><br>
If you can't be sure your heart ain't still here with me<br><br>
Still wanting me<br><br>
Now that can be my car that can be my house<br><br>
That can be my baby boy that you're nursing<br><br>
That can be the trash which I always take out<br><br>
That could be the chair that I love to chill in<br><br>
That could be my food on the table at the end of the day<br><br>
Hugs and the kisses all the love we made<br><br>
What the hell do you expect me to say<br><br>
What if it was really suppose to be this way<br><br>
What if you were really suppose to be with me<br><br>
What if we were wrong about each other<br><br>
What if you were really meant for me<br><br>
What if we were suppose to be together<br><br>
Would that not mean anything<br><br>
What if that was suppose to be my house that you go home to every day<br><br>
How can you be sure that things are better<br><br>
If you can't be sure your heart ain't still here with me<br><br>
Still wanting me<br><br>
What if we were wrong about each other<br><br>
What if you were really meant for me<br><br>
What if we were suppose to be together<br><br>
Would that not mean anything<br><br>
What if that was suppose to be my house that you go home to every day<br><br>
How can you be sure that things are better<br><br>
If you can't be sure your heart ain't still here with me<br><br>
Still wanting me<br><br>
What if we were wrong about each other<br><br>
What if you were really meant for me<br><br>
What if we were suppose to be together<br><br>
Would that not mean anything<br><br>
What if that was suppose to be my house that you go home to every day<br><br>
How can you be sure that things are better<br><br>
If you can't be sure your heart ain't still here with me<br><br>
Still wanting me
