Hard To Say I - 陈小春<br><br>
Everybody needs a little time away<br><br>
I heard her say<br><br>
From each other<br><br>
Even lovers need a holiday<br><br>
Far away<br><br>
From each other<br><br>
Hold me now<br><br>
It's hard for me to say I'm sorry<br><br>
I just want you to stay<br><br>
And after all that we've been through<br><br>
I will make it up to you<br><br>
I promise you baby<br><br>
And after all that's been said and done<br><br>
You're just the part of me I can't let go<br><br>
Couldn't stand to be kept away<br><br>
Enough for the day<br><br>
From your body<br><br>
Wouldn't wanna be swept away<br><br>
Far away<br><br>
From the one that I love<br><br>
Hold me now<br><br>
It's hard for me to say I'm sorry<br><br>
I just want you to know<br><br>
You to know<br><br>
Hold me now<br><br>
I really want to tell you I'm sorry<br><br>
I could never let you go<br><br>
And never that you've been through<br><br>
I will make it up to you<br><br>
I promise you<br><br>
And after all that's been said and done<br><br>
You're just the part of me I can't let go<br><br>
I can't let it go
