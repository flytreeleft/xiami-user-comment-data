## 歌词

<div>
男：To just act like we never were<br><br>
To come around and not show hurt<br><br>
How dare we greet by shaking hands<br><br>
Just months ago I was your man was your man<br><br>
Verbally we'd agreed it was over<br><br>
And we were through<br><br>
I'm trying to compose myself<br><br>
But I just can't get over you girl<br><br>
We can't be friends<br><br>
Yeah no oh<br><br>
We can't be friends<br><br>
Deborah you know<br><br>
I can't go on being just your friend yeah<br><br>
We can't be friends<br><br>
Cuz I'm still in love with you<br><br>
女：I went by mother's saw your car there<br><br>
To her you're still family<br><br>
And it don't seem fair<br><br>
For everyone to just go on<br><br>
And I've tried and I can't do it<br><br>
Cuz I'm still torn<br><br>
I tried to think of you as just another love<br><br>
In my past that didn't last<br><br>
But it's not that simple baby<br><br>
We can't be friends<br><br>
Oh no no no<br><br>
We can't be friends<br><br>
If we if we can't be lovers<br><br>
We can't be friends<br><br>
Cuz I'm still in love<br><br>
合：You may see me staring<br><br>
Or catch me in a daze<br><br>
May see me hang my head<br><br>
When you come my way<br><br>
Don't get too close to me<br><br>
And expect me to behave<br><br>
I might just steal a kiss<br><br>
If you come near my face<br><br>
What I'm trying to say<br><br>
We can't be friends<br><br>
Can you look me in the eyes<br><br>
And honestly say you don't love me<br><br>
Said do you know<br><br>
R.L. I know<br><br>
I'll never ever find another love like you oh no<br><br>
I love you too much baby<br><br>
I love you too much oh<br><br>
We can't be friends I'm still in love<br><br>
With you<br><br>
With you<br><br>
I am<br><br>
Still in love<br><br>
Still in love<br><br>
You didn't have to leave<br><br>
With you
