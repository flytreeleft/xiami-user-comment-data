Luther Vandross - Take You Out<br><br>
Yeah  yeah    yeah <br><br>
Here it is<br><br>
She caught me by surprised I must say<br><br>
Cause I never have seen such a pretty face<br><br>
With such a warm and beautiful smile<br><br>
It wasn't hard for me to notice her style<br><br>
I was fascinated  surely<br><br>
She took my heart and held it for me<br><br>
I wouldn't let her get away<br><br>
Not until she heard me say<br><br>
Excuse me miss (Yeah   )<br><br>
But what's your name<br><br>
Where are you from (Heh   ) and can I come<br><br>
And possibly  "Can I take you out tonight"<br><br>
To a movie  (Yeah   ) to the park<br><br>
I'll have you home (Oh    Hoo ) before it's dark<br><br>
So let me know  "Can I take you out tonight"<br><br>
Don't care if I get rejected<br><br>
At least then I won't regret<br><br>
Regret the fact I missed the chance for romance At least<br><br>
I'll walk away knowing<br><br>
I tried my best and I'm going<br><br>
I'm going on with my day<br><br>
Cause at least she heard me say<br><br>
Excuse me miss (Come On)<br><br>
But what's your name<br><br>
Where are you from (Hey You) and can I come<br><br>
And possibly  "Can I take you out tonight"<br><br>
To a movie  (Yeah     ) to the park<br><br>
I'll have you home (Oh    Hoo ) before it's dark<br><br>
So let me know  "Can I take you out tonight"<br><br>
Excuse me miss (Oh  I wanna know you are think I can show you good love)<br><br>
But what's your name<br><br>
Where are you from and can I come<br><br>
And possibly  "Can I take you out tonight"<br><br>
To a movie  (Tonight) to the park (Don't Worry)<br><br>
I'll have you home (eh ) before it's dark<br><br>
So "let me know  can I take you out tonight"<br><br>
Heh  That's why I had to come over<br><br>
And introduce myself to you<br><br>
Cause you're never gonna know<br><br>
Where you'll find love  oh hoo <br><br>
And hopefully I found it in you  Oh    yeah <br><br>
Excuse me miss<br><br>
But what's your name (Oh    oh yeah )<br><br>
Where are you from and can I come<br><br>
And possibly  (Oh Yeah ) "Can I take you out tonight"<br><br>
To a movie  (Got a love for you baby ) to the park<br><br>
I'll have you home (I'll come get you baby ) before it's dark<br><br>
So let me know  (Heh heh   ) "Can I take you out tonight"<br><br>
Excuse me miss (come on  Tonight)<br><br>
But what's your name<br><br>
Where are you from (eh  Tonight) and can I come<br><br>
And possibly  "Can I take you out tonight" (Hoo )<br><br>
To a movie  to the park (yeah)<br><br>
I'll have you home (Hoo oh ) before it's dark<br><br>
So let me know  can I take you out tonight (Let me make a house a home  baby )<br><br>
Excuse me miss<br><br>
But what's your name (yah  yah )<br><br>
Where are you from (ah ) and can I come (oh  can I come)<br><br>
And possibly  "can I take" you out "tonight"<br><br>
To a "movie  to the park"<br><br>
"I'll have you home before it's dark"<br><br>
"So let me know  can I take you out tonight"<br><br>
Excuse me miss
