Like A Woman_Tony Rich - 陈小春<br><br>
I don't know what I'll do to you<br><br>
But I find myself at the East River<br><br>
Waiting to meet with you<br><br>
And late at night I keep dreaming of you<br><br>
We're making love on the sofa that belongs to you<br><br>
We fly higher than kites when we're face to face<br><br>
Searching for time alone in this here violent place<br><br>
And we don't know who we are or why we met<br><br>
But it's strangely good in some sort of freakish way<br><br>
The things we'll do will make you feel like a woman<br><br>
Falling in love with a man she doesn't even know<br><br>
The words we'll say will send your mind on a journey<br><br>
Looking for self understanding of the things we've done<br><br>
Catch your breath you're heart beats too fast<br><br>
You feel my presence in your arms will not last oh lover<br><br>
I have an urge I must kiss your hand<br><br>
The first symptoms of this woman's<br><br>
Fragrance lies deep in my head<br><br>
So we slit our wrists and we join our blood<br><br>
To symbolize some type of crazy oath<br><br>
Sometimes it feels so wrong but it could be good enough<br><br>
To sacrifice our freedom for each other's hearts<br><br>
The things we'll do will make you feel like a woman<br><br>
Falling in love with a man she doesn't even know<br><br>
The words we'll say will send your mind on a journey<br><br>
Looking for self understanding of the things we've done<br><br>
Now come on honey<br><br>
In love with a man she doesn't even know<br><br>
Whoa come along<br><br>
I said the things we'll do will make you feel like a woman<br><br>
Falling in love with a man she doesn't even know<br><br>
The words we'll say will send your mind on a journey<br><br>
(Long journey)<br><br>
Looking for self understanding of the things we've done<br><br>
The things that we'll do will make you feel like a woman<br><br>
Falling in love with a man she doesn't even know
