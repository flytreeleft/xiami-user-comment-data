## 歌词

<div>
Yo did you just like get our partying<br><br>
Then I might be talking about you mm hmm<br><br>
And if you're looking at your tape deck<br><br>
Or your cd player like what is that<br><br>
Yeah possibilty is it's you<br><br>
If you actin' nonchalant lookin' out the window like<br><br>
You ain't really feelin' this and like uh<br><br>
Yeah it might be you uh<br><br>
And if you sittin' still because you're a little bit nervous<br><br>
Cuz you really don't know what I'm getting ready to come with<br><br>
It's you<br><br>
Oh but uh ones that are bobbin' their heads up and down<br><br>
And feeling this cuz uh it's all that<br><br>
I represent you aight<br><br>
So we gon' do this huh huh<br><br>
How many y'all don' did it did it before<br><br>
Freak somebody's shit knowing that it ain't yours<br><br>
Now there's a ramification just for that<br><br>
Bite somebody sug' and they gon' bite you back<br><br>
You busy smilin' smilin' grinnin' in my face<br><br>
Whole time tryna take my place<br><br>
Now this is for the realsoul cat leaders of the pack<br><br>
Just remember God got yo' back<br><br>
It's too many ya'll ridin' in the same boat<br><br>
Getting too heavy and the boat can't float<br><br>
Here's a little something to make you think<br><br>
You goin' down if the mother sinks<br><br>
It's too many ya'll ridin' in the same boat<br><br>
It's getting too heavy and the boat can't float<br><br>
Here's a little something to make you think<br><br>
You goin' down under if the mother sinks<br><br>
You know that ya'll oughta quit it quit it for sure<br><br>
Slidin' by on Xerox thinkin' we don't know<br><br>
That's the luck if the rhythm can't stand in the place<br><br>
The only thing that's missing is my face<br><br>
You got me burnin' yearnin' turnin' in my sleep<br><br>
Cuz soul music be who I be<br><br>
Now this is for the real soul cat leaders of the pack<br><br>
Just remember God got yo' back<br><br>
See it's too many ya'll ridin' in the same boat<br><br>
Getting too heavy and the boat can't float<br><br>
Here's a little something to make you think<br><br>
You goin' down if the mother sinks<br><br>
Soul soul soul insurance<br><br>
Soul soul soul insurance<br><br>
Soul soul soul insurance<br><br>
Soul soul soul insurance<br><br>
See it's too many ya'll ridin' in the same boat<br><br>
Getting too heavy and the boat can't float<br><br>
Here's a little something to make you think<br><br>
You goin' down if the mother sinks<br><br>
Too many of ya'll<br><br>
Too many of ya'll to come for<br><br>
Too many of ya'll<br><br>
Too many of ya'll to come for<br><br>
Too many of ya'll<br><br>
Too many of ya'll to come for<br><br>
Too many of ya'll<br><br>
Too many of ya'll to come for<br><br>
Imitating business dealing<br><br>
Melody tryna find<br><br>
Some were born to sin some weren't<br><br>
But baby that's ok cuz I learned<br><br>
You really know soul music them<br><br>
You'll be around for a while<br><br>
But if you're taking lessons from the leader<br><br>
Baby kiss yo' ass goodbye<br><br>
Soul soul music<br><br>
This is for the real brothers who<br><br>
Are called the leaders of the pack<br><br>
You know who you are you said it all baby hey<br><br>
Big ups to the peeps that kept the wheel turning yo'<br><br>
To my mellow Curtis Mayfield<br><br>
Mr Marvin Gaye<br><br>
Mr Donnie Hathaway uh<br><br>
Betty Wright<br><br>
True pioneers of soul music<br><br>
And to the new generation of soul<br><br>
Leaders of the pack<br><br>
You know who you are<br><br>
Big ups to you<br><br>
Keep it going going going
