  "lyric": "Like A Woman_Tony Rich - 陈小春<br>\nI don't know what I'll do to you<br>\nBut I find myself at the East River<br>\nWaiting to meet with you<br>\nAnd late at night I keep dreaming of you<br>\nWe're making love on the sofa that belongs to you<br>\nWe fly higher than kites when we're face to face<br>\nSearching for time alone in this here violent place<br>\nAnd we don't know who we are or why we met<br>\nBut it's strangely good in some sort of freakish way<br>\nThe things we'll do will make you feel like a woman<br>\nFalling in love with a man she doesn't even know<br>\nThe words we'll say will send your mind on a journey<br>\nLooking for self understanding of the things we've done<br>\nCatch your breath you're heart beats too fast<br>\nYou feel my presence in your arms will not last oh lover<br>\nI have an urge I must kiss your hand<br>\nThe first symptoms of this woman's<br>\nFragrance lies deep in my head<br>\nSo we slit our wrists and we join our blood<br>\nTo symbolize some type of crazy oath<br>\nSometimes it feels so wrong but it could be good enough<br>\nTo sacrifice our freedom for each other's hearts<br>\nThe things we'll do will make you feel like a woman<br>\nFalling in love with a man she doesn't even know<br>\nThe words we'll say will send your mind on a journey<br>\nLooking for self understanding of the things we've done<br>\nNow come on honey<br>\nIn love with a man she doesn't even know<br>\nWhoa come along<br>\nI said the things we'll do will make you feel like a woman<br>\nFalling in love with a man she doesn't even know<br>\nThe words we'll say will send your mind on a journey<br>\n(Long journey)<br>\nLooking for self understanding of the things we've done<br>\nThe things that we'll do will make you feel like a woman<br>\nFalling in love with a man she doesn't even know",
