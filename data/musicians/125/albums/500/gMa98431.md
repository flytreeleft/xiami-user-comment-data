## 歌词

<div>
Uh Yeah<br><br>
A Keys<br><br>
Rear View<br><br>
Uh Oh Uh Oh<br><br>
Uh Oh Uh Oh<br><br>
AK 2000<br><br>
Oh Uh Oh<br><br>
It happened quickly<br><br>
All of a sudden<br><br>
I was caught up with another man<br><br>
Who wanted<br><br>
To be closer<br><br>
But now<br><br>
I know better and I'm<br><br>
Hoping<br><br>
We Can<br><br>
Start Again<br><br>
I know that does not take away what i have <br><br>
done So<br><br>
Let me show you how deep my love goes<br><br>
For you<br><br>
Cos you live and learn and that's how you find out who is true<br><br>
And I found out that you were the one<br><br>
I was deceived<br><br>
Baby please forgive me<br><br>
Don't want what we had to change<br><br>
It's easier for us to get further<br><br>
Don't look in the rear view mirror<br><br>
Now that we are<br><br>
Back again together<br><br>
I want to show you<br><br>
How i mean forever<br><br>
I'll do my best to shower<br><br>
You with love and attention<br><br>
Don't ever have to mention<br><br>
a song after it ends<br><br>
I know that does not take away what i have <br><br>
done So<br><br>
Let me show you how deep my love goes<br><br>
For you<br><br>
Cos you live and learn and that's how you find out who is true<br><br>
And I found out that you were the one<br><br>
I was deceived<br><br>
Baby please forgive me<br><br>
Don't want what we had to change<br><br>
It's easier for us to get further<br><br>
Don't look in the rear view mirror<br><br>
I can't change what I have done before<br><br>
But now I know that your love means so much more<br><br>
Than anything that had ever come my way<br><br>
Keep your eyes on what we have today<br><br>
I was deceived<br><br>
Baby please forgive me<br><br>
Don't want what we had to change<br><br>
It's easier for us to get further<br><br>
Don't look in the rear view mirror<br><br>
I was deceived<br><br>
Baby please forgive me<br><br>
Don't want what we had to change<br><br>
It's easier for us to get further<br><br>
Don't look in the rear view mirror<br><br>
I was deceived<br><br>
Baby please forgive me<br><br>
Don't want what we had to change<br><br>
It's easier for us to get further<br><br>
Don't look in the rear view mirror<br><br>
I was deceived<br><br>
Baby please forgive me<br><br>
Don't want what we had to change<br><br>
If we can get past the past<br><br>
It happened so fast (so fast)<br><br>
If we don't look back (look back)<br><br>
in the rear view mirror<br><br>
I was deceived<br><br>
Baby please forgive me<br><br>
Don't know what we had to change<br><br>
It's easier for us to get further<br><br>
Don't look in the rear view mirror
