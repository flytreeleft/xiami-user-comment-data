When He Sings<br><br>
林一峰<br><br>
<br><br>
Lyrics by 猪雄<br><br>
<br><br>
He walks on the thin line<br><br>
between light and darkness<br><br>
Not decent, but beautiful<br><br>
Where lights in the late nights<br><br>
always brighter than the candles on the dining table<br><br>
But something they will never know<br><br>
the way I love him<br><br>
and I guess he loved me so<br><br>
<br><br>
All his lovers say he's selfish<br><br>
but they don't know what he'd been through<br><br>
His heart is somewhere out there<br><br>
though I never had a clue<br><br>
Sometimes in a funny mood<br><br>
and he's always out of tune<br><br>
But I know that when he sings he can<br><br>
break my heart in two<br><br>
<br><br>
There's a place in time<br><br>
where the river runs so peaceful<br><br>
where his mind meets my soul<br><br>
We could simply forget<br><br>
all the sorrows and the troubles of desire that we chose<br><br>
<br><br>
But something they will never know<br><br>
the way I love him<br><br>
And yes, he loved me so<br><br>
<br><br>
All his lovers say he's selfish<br><br>
but they don't know what he'd been through<br><br>
His heart is somewhere out there<br><br>
though I never had a clue<br><br>
Sometimes in a fuuny mood<br><br>
and he's always out of tune<br><br>
But I know that when he sings he can<br><br>
break my heart in two<br><br>
<br><br>
And I know that when he sings he can<br><br>
break my heart in two
