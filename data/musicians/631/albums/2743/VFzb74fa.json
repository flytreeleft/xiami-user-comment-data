With everything we see<br>\nI never want anything, it's easy,you buy whatever I need<br>\n<br>\nLook at my hopes, look at my dreams, the currency we've spent<br>\nI love you, oh, you pay my rent<br>\nI love you, you pay my rent<br>\n<br>\nYou phone me in the evening on Hearsay,and bought me caviar<br>\nYou took me to a restaurant off Broadway to tell me who you are<br>\n<br>\nWe never ever argue, we never calculate the currency we've spent<br>\nI love you, oh, you pay my rent<br>\nI love you, you pay my rent<br>\nI love you, OHH...yeah<br>\n<br>\nYou dress me up, I'm your puppet (dress me dress me dress me dress me)<br>\nYou buy me things, I love it (buy me buy me buy me buy me)<br>\nYou bring me food, I need it (bring me bring me bring me bring me)<br>\nYou give me love (Gimme Gimme Gimme Gimme)<br>\nYou dress me up, I'm your puppet (dress me dress me dress me dress me)<br>\nYou buy me things, I love it (buy me buy me buy me buy me)<br>\nYou bring me food, I need it (bring me bring me bring me bring me)<br>\nYou give me love (Gimme Gimme Gimme Gimme)<br>\n<br>\nAnd look at the two of us in sympathy, and sometimes ecstasy<br>\nWords mean so little, and money less,when you're lying next to me<br>\nBut look at my hopes, look at my dreams, the currency we've spent<br>\nI love you, oh, you pay my rent (It's easy it's so easy)<br>\nI love you, you pay my rent<br>\n<br>\nLook at my hopes, look at my dreams, the currency we've spent<br>\nI love you, oh, you pay my rent (It's easy it's so easy)<br>\nI love you, you pay my rent",
