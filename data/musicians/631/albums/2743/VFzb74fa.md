Rent<br><br>
林一峰<br><br>
<br><br>
Lyrics by 猪雄<br><br>
<br><br>
Look at the two of us in sympathy. With everything we see<br><br>
I never want anything, it's easy,you buy whatever I need<br><br>
<br><br>
Look at my hopes, look at my dreams, the currency we've spent<br><br>
I love you, oh, you pay my rent<br><br>
I love you, you pay my rent<br><br>
<br><br>
You phone me in the evening on Hearsay,and bought me caviar<br><br>
You took me to a restaurant off Broadway to tell me who you are<br><br>
<br><br>
We never ever argue, we never calculate the currency we've spent<br><br>
I love you, oh, you pay my rent<br><br>
I love you, you pay my rent<br><br>
I love you, OHH...yeah<br><br>
<br><br>
You dress me up, I'm your puppet (dress me dress me dress me dress me)<br><br>
You buy me things, I love it (buy me buy me buy me buy me)<br><br>
You bring me food, I need it (bring me bring me bring me bring me)<br><br>
You give me love (Gimme Gimme Gimme Gimme)<br><br>
You dress me up, I'm your puppet (dress me dress me dress me dress me)<br><br>
You buy me things, I love it (buy me buy me buy me buy me)<br><br>
You bring me food, I need it (bring me bring me bring me bring me)<br><br>
You give me love (Gimme Gimme Gimme Gimme)<br><br>
<br><br>
And look at the two of us in sympathy, and sometimes ecstasy<br><br>
Words mean so little, and money less,when you're lying next to me<br><br>
But look at my hopes, look at my dreams, the currency we've spent<br><br>
I love you, oh, you pay my rent (It's easy it's so easy)<br><br>
I love you, you pay my rent<br><br>
<br><br>
Look at my hopes, look at my dreams, the currency we've spent<br><br>
I love you, oh, you pay my rent (It's easy it's so easy)<br><br>
I love you, you pay my rent
