## 歌词

<div>
Be a good boy for a whole week<br><br>
Stuck in the car sardined on the streets<br><br>
Summer's here bodies in heat<br><br>
You know what I mean<br><br>
Pack some hot dogs we need some meat<br><br>
To do the hard work to make us complete<br><br>
Summer's here everything's in heat<br><br>
Let's give us a treat<br><br>
Come on<br><br>
It's time for me to have some fun<br><br>
Just some causal fun<br><br>
Don't have to ask no one<br><br>
It's time for you to have some fun<br><br>
It's gonna be a blast<br><br>
Don't be shy just come<br><br>
It's time for me to have some fun<br><br>
Just some causal fun<br><br>
Don't have to ask no one<br><br>
It's time for you to have some fun<br><br>
It's gonna be a blast<br><br>
Don't be shy just come<br><br>
It's time for me to have some fun<br><br>
Just some causal fun<br><br>
Don't have to ask no one<br><br>
It's time for you to have some fun<br><br>
It's gonna be a blast<br><br>
Don't be shy just come<br><br>
Let's get started hop off the truck<br><br>
Pitch a tent unload some stuff<br><br>
The flap is down just the two of us<br><br>
Let's keep out the bugs
