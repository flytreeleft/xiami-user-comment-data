<br><br>
If you hear this on the radio<br><br>
Then we've already said our last goodbye<br><br>
I won't be there when you get home<br><br>
By now there's someone else that hears you cry<br><br>
I wonder if he holds you like I did<br><br>
I hope that he can love you better<br><br>
Cause we were everything that's right at the wrong time<br><br>
I didn't want to lose you<br><br>
Leave you with a broken heart<br><br>
But wherever we are, we're miles apart<br><br>
I know that we tried, but this is the last goodbye<br><br>
Oh, I didn't want to let you go<br><br>
But wherever we are, we're miles apart<br><br>
I know that we tried, but this is the last goodbye<br><br>
We were almost beautiful<br><br>
A broken piece of art put on display<br><br>
But we were never possible<br><br>
Another perfect moment thrown away<br><br>
I know somebody out there will love you<br><br>
They'll be the forever we never were<br><br>
Cause we were everything that's right at the wrong time<br><br>
I didn't want to lose you<br><br>
Leave you with a broken heart<br><br>
But wherever we are, we're miles apart<br><br>
I know that we tried, but this is the last goodbye<br><br>
Oh, I didn't want to let you go<br><br>
But wherever we are, we're miles apart<br><br>
I know that we tried, but this is the last goodbye<br><br>
Maximal R B - The Freshest   Hottest R B/Hip-Hop Source!<br><br>
If you hear this on the radio<br><br>
Then we've already said our last goodbye<br><br>
Our last goodbye<br><br>
I didn't want to lose you<br><br>
Leave you with a broken heart<br><br>
But wherever we are, we're miles apart<br><br>
I know that we tried, but this is the last goodbye<br><br>
Oh…<br><br>
The last goodbye<br><br>
I know that we tried, but this is the last goodbye
