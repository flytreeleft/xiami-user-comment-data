## 歌词

<div>
My home has been a warrior field<br><br>
Where now and then I've seen<br><br>
A rainbow rising over the graves<br><br>
Down in the gentle green<br><br>
And as I waltzed across the mine<br><br>
Time sped to breathlessly<br><br>
As I fought for love<br><br>
And I sang for love<br><br>
Too late love comes to me<br><br>
I saw you coming over the hill<br><br>
So strong so brave so true<br><br>
I fell down to my knees and cried<br><br>
The way I used to do<br><br>
It came at such surprise to me<br><br>
I thought those tears had passed<br><br>
Is it god who laughs this heart awake<br><br>
Too late love comes at last<br><br>
<br><br>
O lovers how they come and go<br><br>
Like waves upon the shore<br><br>
Brave hearts can drown in the briny deep<br><br>
And still cry out for more<br><br>
My treasure's in the water now<br><br>
My pearls are lost at sea<br><br>
And my heart must bend like a rainbow<br><br>
Too late you've come to me
</div>
