## 歌词

<div>
Puff the magic dragon<br><br>
Lived by the sea<br><br>
And frolicked in the autumn mist<br><br>
In a land called Honalee<br><br>
Very nice<br><br>
<br><br>
Puff the magic dragon<br><br>
Lived by the sea<br><br>
And frolicked in the autumn mist<br><br>
In a land called Honalee<br><br>
Little Jackie Paper<br><br>
Loved that rascal Puff<br><br>
And brought him strings and sealing wax<br><br>
And other fancy stuff<br><br>
Oh Puff the magic dragon<br><br>
Lived by the sea<br><br>
And frolicked in the autumn mist<br><br>
In a land called Honalee<br><br>
Puff the magic dragon<br><br>
Lived by the sea<br><br>
And frolicked in the autumn mist<br><br>
In a land called Honalee<br><br>
Together they would travel<br><br>
On a boat with billowed sail<br><br>
Jackie kept a lookout<br><br>
Perched on Puff's gigantic tail<br><br>
Noble kings and princes<br><br>
Would bow whene'er they came<br><br>
And pirate ships would lower their flags<br><br>
When Puff roared out his name<br><br>
Sing with me<br><br>
Puff the magic dragon<br><br>
Lived by the sea<br><br>
And frolicked in the autumn mist<br><br>
In a land called Honalee<br><br>
Oh puff the magic dragon<br><br>
Lived by the sea<br><br>
And frolicked in the autumn mist<br><br>
In a land called Honalee<br><br>
A dragon lives forever<br><br>
But not so little girls and boys<br><br>
Painted wings and giants' rings<br><br>
Make way for other toys<br><br>
One grey night it happened<br><br>
Jackie Paper came no more<br><br>
So Puff that mighty dragon<br><br>
He ceased his fearless roar<br><br>
His head was bent in sorrow<br><br>
Green scales fell like rain<br><br>
Puff no longer went to play<br><br>
Along the cherry lane<br><br>
Without his lifelong friend<br><br>
Puff could not be brave<br><br>
So Puff that mighty dragon<br><br>
Sadly slipped into his cave<br><br>
Puff the magic dragon<br><br>
Lived by the sea<br><br>
And frolicked in the Autumn mist<br><br>
In a land called Honalee<br><br>
Time to wake up<br><br>
Puff the magic dragon<br><br>
Lived by the sea<br><br>
And frolicked in the Autumn mist<br><br>
In a land called Honalee<br><br>
Oh together now<br><br>
Puff the magic dragon<br><br>
Lived by the sea present tales<br><br>
And frolicked in the autumn mist<br><br>
In a land called Honalee<br><br>
One last time<br><br>
Puff the magic dragon<br><br>
Lived by the sea<br><br>
And frolicked in the autumn mist<br><br>
In a land called Honalee
