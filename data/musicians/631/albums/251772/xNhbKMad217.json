  "lyric": "My home has been a warrior field<br>\nWhere now and then I've seen<br>\nA rainbow rising over the graves<br>\nDown in the gentle green<br>\nAnd as I waltzed across the mine<br>\nTime sped to breathlessly<br>\nAs I fought for love<br>\nAnd I sang for love<br>\nToo late love comes to me<br>\nI saw you coming over the hill<br>\nSo strong so brave so true<br>\nI fell down to my knees and cried<br>\nThe way I used to do<br>\nIt came at such surprise to me<br>\nI thought those tears had passed<br>\nIs it god who laughs this heart awake<br>\nToo late love comes at last<br>\n<br>\nO lovers how they come and go<br>\nLike waves upon the shore<br>\nBrave hearts can drown in the briny deep<br>\nAnd still cry out for more<br>\nMy treasure's in the water now<br>\nMy pearls are lost at sea<br>\nAnd my heart must bend like a rainbow<br>\nToo late you've come to me",
