## 歌词

<div>
The first Noel the angel did say<br><br>
Was to certain poor shepherds<br><br>
in fields as they lay<br><br>
In fields where they lay<br><br>
keeping their sheep<br><br>
On a cold winters night<br><br>
that was so deep<br><br>
<br><br>
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel<br><br>
Born is the King of Israel<br><br>
<br><br>
And they looked up and saw a star<br><br>
Shining in the east beyond them far<br><br>
And to the earth it gave great light<br><br>
And so it continued both day and night<br><br>
<br><br>
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel<br><br>
Born is the King of Israel<br><br>
<br><br>
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel<br><br>
Born is the King of Israel<br><br>
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel<br><br>
Born is the King of Israel
</div>
