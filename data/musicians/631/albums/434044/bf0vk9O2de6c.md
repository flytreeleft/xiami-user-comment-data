## 歌词

<div>
Written by：The Pancakes<br><br>
<br><br>
Here it comes the sun<br><br>
Here it comes the number one<br><br>
Struggling through the rain<br><br>
Smuggled in a non-stop train<br><br>
If you come<br><br>
Come by run<br><br>
It'll bring us much more fun<br><br>
Playing puns<br><br>
Eating buns<br><br>
Doing what we haven't done<br><br>
<br><br>
Write me however you want<br><br>
Read me whenever you like<br><br>
Take me wherever you go<br><br>
Tell me whatever you know<br><br>
Look at what you cannot see<br><br>
Listen to what you can't hear<br><br>
Touch what you're unable to feel<br><br>
Sniff what you're unable to smell<br><br>
<br><br>
Now the drugs don't work<br><br>
And the memories only hurt<br><br>
Sit where as I please<br><br>
Writing nonsense poetries<br><br>
What if I've eaten your popcorn<br><br>
Would it turn you on<br><br>
What if I tell you sunday is gone<br><br>
Would you blow the horn<br><br>
<br><br>
Write me however you want<br><br>
Read me whenever you like<br><br>
Take me wherever you go<br><br>
Tell me whatever you know<br><br>
Look at what you cannot see<br><br>
Listen to what you can't hear<br><br>
Touch what you're unable to feel<br><br>
Sniff what you're unable to smell
