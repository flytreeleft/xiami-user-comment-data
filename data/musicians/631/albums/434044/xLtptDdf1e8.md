dental romance - the pancakes<br><br>
he's in the middle of my heart<br><br>
though i see him only once in a while<br><br>
you'll find my name in his file<br><br>
i try to pretend to be calm<br><br>
every time we meet each other right here<br><br>
and we've never been this near<br><br>
if i ask you for a date<br><br>
will you decline<br><br>
do i need to keep my teeth all decayed<br><br>
so i can see you<br><br>
and you'll know the reasons why<br><br>
when you take a look out through my window<br><br>
and you'll know what it means to me<br><br>
how can i get through<br><br>
do you find it romantic<br><br>
in this small room<br><br>
we met we knew each other<br><br>
though he never calls me by my name<br><br>
dentist i believe in you<br><br>
i won't brush my teeth again<br><br>
i will eat more candies in the evening<br><br>
i will stand all the brought-about pain<br><br>
i know if i give you money<br><br>
you won't accept<br><br>
unless i come with my teeth all gone bad<br><br>
then i can pay you<br><br>
and you'll know the reasons why<br><br>
when you take a look out through my window<br><br>
and you'll know what it means to me<br><br>
how can i get through<br><br>
do you find it romantic<br><br>
in this small room<br><br>
we met we knew each other<br><br>
though he never calls me by my name<br><br>
dentist i believe in you<br><br>
my friend<br><br>
i've got a story i'd like to tell<br><br>
somehow no one seems to believe at all<br><br>
so what about you<br><br>
and you'll know the reasons why<br><br>
when you take a look out through my window<br><br>
and you'll know what it means to me<br><br>
how can i get through<br><br>
do you find it romantic<br><br>
in this small room<br><br>
we met we knew each other<br><br>
though he never calls me by my name<br><br>
dentist i believe in you
