  "lyric": "Just before our love got lost you said<br>\n I am as constant as a northern star and I said,<br>\n Constantly in the darkness<br>\n Where's that at?<br>\n If you want me I'll be in the bar<br>\n<br>\nOn the back of a cartoon coaster<br>\n In the blue TV screen light<br>\n I drew a map of Canada<br>\n Oh Canada<br>\n With your face sketched on it twice<br>\n<br>\nOh you are in my blood like holy wine<br>\n You taste so bitter<br>\n And so sweet oh<br>\n I could drink a case of you darling and I would<br>\n Still be on my feet<br>\n Oh I would still be on my feet<br>\n<br>\nOh I am a lonely painter<br>\n I live in a box of paints<br>\n I'm frightened by the devil<br>\n And I'm drawn to those ones that ain't afraid<br>\n I remember that time that you told me, you said<br>\n \"Love is touching souls\"<br>\n Surely you touched mine 'cause<br>\n Part of you pours out of me<br>\n In these lines from time to time<br>\n<br>\nOh you are in my blood like holy wine<br>\n You taste so bitter<br>\n And so sweet oh<br>\n I could drink a case of you darling<br>\n Still I'd be on my feet<br>\n I would still be on my feet<br>\n<br>\nI met a woman<br>\n She had a mouth like yours, she knew your life<br>\n She knew your devils and your deeds and she said<br>\n \"Go to him<br>\n stay with him if you can<br>\n But be prepared to bleed\"<br>\n<br>\nOh but you are in my blood you're my holy wine<br>\n You're so bitter<br>\n bitter and so sweet oh<br>\n I could drink a case of you darling<br>\n Still I'd be on my feet<br>\n I would still be on my feet<br>\n hmm",
