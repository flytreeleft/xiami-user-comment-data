林一峰 - When He Sings<br><br>
lrc by Jermen<br><br>
He walks the thin line <br><br>
Between light and darkness <br><br>
So peculiar, so natural <br><br>
The stars disappear in the shadow of his tears <br><br>
Hmmm it makes my heart glow <br><br>
<br><br>
Something they will never know <br><br>
The way I love him <br><br>
And I guess he loved me so <br><br>
<br><br>
You may say he's kind of stubborn <br><br>
But you don't know what he'd been through <br><br>
His heart is somewhere out there <br><br>
Though I never had a clue <br><br>
Sometimes in a funny mood <br><br>
And he's always out of tune <br><br>
But I know that when he sings he can break my heart in two <br><br>
<br><br>
There's a place in time <br><br>
Where what's forgiven but not forgotten <br><br>
Then we could simply forget <br><br>
All the sorrows and the troubles of desire that we chose <br><br>
<br><br>
But something they will never know <br><br>
The way I love him <br><br>
And yes, he loved me so <br><br>
<br><br>
You may say he's kind of stubborn <br><br>
But you don't know what he'd been through <br><br>
His heart is somewhere out there <br><br>
Though I never had a clue <br><br>
Sometimes in a funny mood <br><br>
And he's always out of tune <br><br>
But I know that when he sings he can break my heart in two <br><br>
<br><br>
Yes I know that when he sings he can break my heart in two<br><br>
