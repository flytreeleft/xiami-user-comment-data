## 歌词

<div>
Martin<br><br>
演唱：林一峰(Yi Fung Lam)<br><br>
<br><br>
Maybe 21st's not the right time <br><br>
Maybe my expectation was a little bit high <br><br>
Or maybe cos i was still drunk since may <br><br>
Or between us there is nothing to say <br><br>
To be frank i have forgotten your voice <br><br>
To be honest i can't even remember your face <br><br>
Somehow in my heart you've occupied a place <br><br>
Every now and then you make me fall <br><br>
You bring me sore <br><br>
So by the time you came passing by <br><br>
I knew it was all designed <br><br>
I knew there's no place where i could hide <br><br>
You know i can't decide <br><br>
You know i can't deny <br><br>
So by the time you give me a smell<br><br>
And then you left me behind <br><br>
Oh martin you messed it all up <br><br>
how you took me up into the sky <br><br>
let me fall and let me cry <br><br>
All along    All along <br><br>
All along i'd been waiting for your call <br><br>
After all just a simple lie is nothing at all <br><br>
but you've decided not to call anyway <br><br>
Cos between us there is really nothing to say <br><br>
So by the time you came passing by <br><br>
I knew it was all designed <br><br>
I knew there's no place where i could hide<br><br>
You know i can't decide <br><br>
You know i can't deny <br><br>
So by the time you came kissing me <br><br>
You know you're confusing me <br><br>
Oh martin you know it's all wrong <br><br>
how you threw me up into the sky <br><br>
Shot me down and said goodbye  <br><br>
goodbye  <br><br>
goodbye
