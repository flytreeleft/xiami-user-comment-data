## 歌词

<div>
An only child alone and wild<br><br>
<br>A cabinet maker's son<br><br>
<br>His hands were meant for different work<br><br>
<br>And his heart was known to none<br><br>
<br>He left his home and went his lone<br><br>
<br>And solitary way<br><br>
<br>And he gave to me<br><br>
<br>A gift I know I never can repay<br><br>
<br><br><br>
<br>A quiet man of music<br><br>
<br>Denied a simpler fate<br><br>
<br>He tried to be a soldier once<br><br>
<br>But his music wouldn't wait<br><br>
<br>He earned his love through discipline<br><br>
<br>A thundering, velvet hand<br><br>
<br>His gentle means of sculpting souls<br><br>
<br>Took me years to understand<br><br>
<br><br><br>
<br>The leader of the band is tired<br><br>
<br>And his eyes are growing old<br><br>
<br>But his blood runs through my instrument<br><br>
<br>And his song is in my soul<br><br>
<br>My life has been a poor attempt<br><br>
<br>To imitate the man<br><br>
<br>I'm just a living legacy<br><br>
<br>To the leader of the band<br><br>
<br><br><br>
<br>My brothers' lives were different<br><br>
<br>For they heard another call<br><br>
<br>One went to Chicago<br><br>
<br>And the other to New York<br><br>
<br>And I'm in Colorado<br><br>
<br>When I'm not in some hotel<br><br>
<br>Living out this life I've chose<br><br>
<br>And come to know so well<br><br>
<br><br><br>
<br>I thank you for the music<br><br>
<br>And your stories of the road<br><br>
<br>I thank you for the freedom<br><br>
<br>When it came my time to go<br><br>
<br>I thank you for the kindness<br><br>
<br>And the times when you got tough<br><br>
<br>And, papa, I don't think<br><br>
<br>I said, "I love you" near enough<br><br>
<br><br><br>
<br>The leader of the band is tired<br><br>
<br>And his eyes are growing old<br><br>
<br>But his blood runs through my instrument<br><br>
<br>And his song is in my soul<br><br>
<br>My life has been a poor attempt<br><br>
<br>To imitate the man<br><br>
<br>I'm just a living legacy<br><br>
<br>To the leader of the band<br><br>
<br>I am the living legacy<br><br>
<br>To the leader of the band
