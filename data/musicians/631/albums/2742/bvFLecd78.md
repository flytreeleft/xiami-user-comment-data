## 歌词

<div>
Swaying room as the music starts <br><br>
Strangers making the most of the dark <br><br>
Two by two their bodies become one <br><br>
I see you through the smokey air <br><br>
Can't you feel the weight of my stare <br><br>
You're so close but still a world away <br><br>
What I'm dying to say is that <br><br>
I'm crazy for you <br><br>
Touch me once and you will know It's true <br><br>
I never wanted anyone like this <br><br>
It's all brand new you'll feel it in my kiss <br><br>
I'm crazy for you crazy for you <br><br>
Trying hard to control my heart <br><br>
I walk over to where you are <br><br>
Eye to eye we meet no words at all <br><br>
Slowly now we begin to move <br><br>
Every breath I'm deeper into you <br><br>
Send me to a standing still in time <br><br>
If you read my mind you'll see <br><br>
I'm crazy for you <br><br>
Touch me once and you'll know It's true <br><br>
I never wanted anyone like this <br><br>
It's all brand new you'll feel it in my ooo <br><br>
Oh so crazy for you <br><br>
Touch me once and you will know It's true <br><br>
I never wanted anyone like this <br><br>
It's all brand new you'll feel it in my kiss <br><br>
I'm crazy for you <br><br>
We have to be you oh you <br><br>
Because I love you <br><br>
Can't my eyes love you <br><br>
Nothing come pairs to you and saif or my love for you <br><br>
For you
