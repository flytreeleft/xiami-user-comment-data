## 歌词

<div>
i remember quite clearly now when this story happened <br><br>
the autumn leaves were floating and measured down to the ground <br><br>
recovering the lake where we used to swim like children <br><br>
on the sun would dare to shine <br><br>
that time,we used to be happy <br><br>
well,i thought we were happy<br><br>
bnt the truth was that -- you had been longing to leave me <br><br>
not daring to tell me <br><br>
on that precious night watching the lake vaguely conscious <br><br>
you said: our story was ending <br><br>
<br><br>
now i'm standing here <br><br>
no one to wipe away my tears <br><br>
no one to keep me warm <br><br>
and no one to walk along with <br><br>
no one to make me feel <br><br>
no one to make me whole <br><br>
oh ! what am i to do ? <br><br>
i'm standing here alone <br><br>
it doesn't seem so clear to me <br><br>
what am i supposed to do about this burningheart of mine <br><br>
oh ! what am i to do ? <br><br>
or how should i react ? <br><br>
oh ! tell me please ! <br><br>
(独白) <br><br>
the rain was killing the last days of summer <br><br>
you had been killing my last breath of love <br><br>
since a long time ago ...... <br><br>
i still don't think i'm gonna male it through another love story <br><br>
you took it all away from me <br><br>
and there i stand , i knew i was gonna be the ... <br><br>
the one left behind <br><br>
but still i'm watching the lake vaguely conscious <br><br>
and i knew ---- <br><br>
my life is ending <br><br>
<br><br>
now i'm standing here <br><br>
no one to wipe away my tears <br><br>
no one to keep me warm <br><br>
and no one to walk along with <br><br>
no one to make me feel <br><br>
no one to make me whole <br><br>
oh ! what am i to do ? <br><br>
i'm standing here alone <br><br>
it doesn't seem so clear to me <br><br>
what am i supposed to do about this burningheart of mine <br><br>
oh ! what am i to do ? <br><br>
or how should i react ? <br><br>
oh ! tell me please ! <br><br>
ha ---- <br><br>
ha ----
