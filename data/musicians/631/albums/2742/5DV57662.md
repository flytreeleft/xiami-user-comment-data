## 歌词

<div>
Be a good boy for a whole week<br><br>
Stuck in the car <br><br>
Sardined on the streets<br><br>
Summer's here <br><br>
Bodies in heat<br><br>
You know<br><br>
What I mean<br><br>
Pack some hot dogs <br><br>
We need some meat<br><br>
To do the hard work <br><br>
To make us complete<br><br>
Summer's here <br><br>
Everything's in heat<br><br>
Let's give us a treat<br><br>
It's time for me<br><br>
To have some fun<br><br>
Just some causal fun<br><br>
Don't have to ask no one<br><br>
Don't have to ask no one<br><br>
It's time for you to have some fun<br><br>
It's gonna be a blast<br><br>
Don't be shy just <br><br>
Come<br><br>
It's time for me to have some fun<br><br>
Just some causal fun<br><br>
Don't have to ask no one<br><br>
It's time for you to have some fun<br><br>
It's gonna be a blast<br><br>
Don't be shy just <br><br>
It's time for me to have some fun<br><br>
Just some causal fun<br><br>
Don't have to ask no one<br><br>
It's time for you to have some fun<br><br>
It's gonna be a blast<br><br>
Don't be shy just come<br><br>
Let's get started <br><br>
Hop off the truck<br><br>
Pitch a tent <br><br>
Unload some stuff<br><br>
The flap is down <br><br>
Just the two of us <br><br>
Let's keep out the bugs
