## 歌词

<div>
Walking down the street <br><br>
Lovers oh so sweet <br><br>
While I don't have one to call my own <br><br>
I'm all alone alone again <br><br>
Toothbrushes in two got in my sight <br><br>
In the mirror I tell myself <br><br>
Fight the good fight yeah right <br><br>
Everything is gonna be alright <br><br>
Can have a one night stand if you got a chance <br><br>
Back to the wonderland see some good old friends <br><br>
Who's my next I'll put him on hold <br><br>
My mind says yes my heart says no <br><br>
I'm suddenly single <br><br>
Suddenly suddenly suddenly single <br><br>
Treat yourself sleep yourself just don't calculate <br><br>
Only more to lose and more to waste <br><br>
Cry all the way what would they say <br><br>
There's a time a grief a time to play <br><br>
Can have a one night stand if you got a chance <br><br>
Back to the wonderland see some long lost friends <br><br>
Who's my next I'll put him on hold <br><br>
My mind says yes my heart says no <br><br>
If I talk too much let me have a go <br><br>
If it's really too much I don't wanna know <br><br>
There's my ex don't let me lose control <br><br>
Can have a one night stand if you got a chance <br><br>
Back to the wonderland see some good old friends <br><br>
Who's my next I'll put him on hold <br><br>
My mind says yes my heart says no <br><br>
If I talk too much let me have a go <br><br>
If It's really too much I don't wanna know <br><br>
There's my ex don't let me lose control <br><br>
Can have a one night stand if you got a chance <br><br>
Back to the wonderland see some good old friends <br><br>
Who's my next what else would follow <br><br>
But hey ain't we back on the road <br><br>
I'm happy I'm single yeah <br><br>
So I'm happy I'm single <br><br>
Wu wu wu oh wu wu oh wu <br><br>
On the highway again <br><br>
On the highway again <br><br>
On the highway again <br><br>
Wow
