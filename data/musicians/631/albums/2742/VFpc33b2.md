<div>
the boy from ipanema<br><br>
林一峰<br><br>
<br><br>
lyrics by 猪雄<br><br>
<br><br>
tall and tan and young and handsome<br><br>
the boy from ipanema goes walking<br><br>
and when he passes each one<br><br>
he passes goes...(ai...)<br><br>
<br><br>
when he walks he's like a samba<br><br>
that swings so cool and sways so gently<br><br>
when he passes each one he passes goes...(hi)<br><br>
<br><br>
ooh how i watch him so sadly<br><br>
how can i tell him i kind of like him<br><br>
yes i would give my heart gladly<br><br>
but each day when he walks to the sea<br><br>
he looks straight ahead not at me<br><br>
<br><br>
tall and tan and young and handsome<br><br>
the boy from ipanema goes walking<br><br>
and when he passes i smile<br><br>
he just doesn't see<br><br>
<br><br>
oh...how i watch him so sadly<br><br>
how can i tell him i like him<br><br>
yes i would give my heart gladly<br><br>
but each day when he walks to the sea<br><br>
he looks straight ahead not at me<br><br>
<br><br>
tall and tan and young and handsome<br><br>
the boy from ipanema goes walking<br><br>
and when he passes i smile<br><br>
but he doesn't see...<br><br>
he just doesn't see...<br><br>
no he doesn't see...<br><br>
what's wrong with him?
