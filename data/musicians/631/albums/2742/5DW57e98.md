Dancing Queen<br><br>
林一峰<br><br>
<br><br>
Lyrics by 猪雄<br><br>
You can dance, you can jive, having the time of your life<br><br>
Ooo...let's see that girl, watch that scene, you diggin' the Dancing Queen<br><br>
<br><br>
Friday night and the lights are low<br><br>
Looking out for the place to go<br><br>
Where they play the right music, getting in the swing<br><br>
You come in to look for a king<br><br>
Anybody could be that guy<br><br>
Night is young and the music's high<br><br>
With a bit of rock music, everything is fine<br><br>
You're in the mood for a dance<br><br>
<br><br>
And when you get the chance...<br><br>
You are the Dancing Queen, young and sweet, only seventeen<br><br>
Dancing Queen, feel the beat from the tambourine ohh yeah<br><br>
You can dance, you can jive, having the time of your life<br><br>
Ooo...let's see that girl, watch that scene, you diggin' the Dancing Wueen<br><br>
<br><br>
You're a teaser, go turn them on<br><br>
Leave 'em burnin' then you are gone<br><br>
Looking out for another, anyone will do<br><br>
You're in the mood for a dance<br><br>
<br><br>
So when you get the chance (show them all)<br><br>
That you are the Dancing Queen, young and sweet, only seventeen<br><br>
You Dancing Queen, feel the beat from the tambourine ohh yaaa<br><br>
You can dance but I won't dance, just stay with the boys in the band<br><br>
Ooo...let's see that girl, watch that scene, you diggin' the Dancing Quuen<br><br>
<br><br>
You diggin' the Dancing Quuen ohh yaaa<br><br>
We diggin' the Dancing Quuen<br><br>
You are the Dancing Queen
