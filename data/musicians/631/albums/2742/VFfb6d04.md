## 歌词

<div>
Wu a wu a <br><br>
In the cool of the evening <br><br>
When everything is getting kind of Groovy <br><br>
You call me up and ask me <br><br>
Would I like to go with you and see a movie <br><br>
First I say no I've got some plans for tonight <br><br>
And then I stop and say all right <br><br>
Love is kind of crazy with a spooky little boy like you <br><br>
You always keep me guessing <br><br>
I never seem to know what you are thinking <br><br>
And if a girl looks at you <br><br>
It's for sure your little eye will be a winking <br><br>
I get confused I never know where I stand <br><br>
And then you smile and hold my hand <br><br>
Love is kind of crazy with a spooky little boy like you <br><br>
If you decide some day to stop this little game that you are a playing <br><br>
I'm gonna tell you all the things my heart's spring daing to be singing <br><br>
Just like a ghost you're a haunting my dreams <br><br>
And now I know you that now watch to say <br><br>
Love is kind of crazy with a spooky little boy like you <br><br>
Love is kind of crazy with a spooky little boy like you <br><br>
Love is kind of crazy with a spooky little boy like you <br><br>
Love is kind of crazy with a spooky little boy like you <br><br>
La la la ba lu ba du du
