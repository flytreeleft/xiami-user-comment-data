  "intro": "<p>肥头对于雷顿狗而言，是一个在台北满重要的地方，在那裡玩音乐和认识许许多多的音乐人，所以经常有事无事就在那裡鬼混。 于2018年七月时的某一个下午与C3LL和hung-li 在肥头一起写这一首动感的歌。</p><p></p><p>Around July 2018, we created this song in Fat Tone, our favorite place in Taipei city. Layton used to hang out there a lot with his old bandmates and friends, so he became friends with C3LL and hung- li, amazing musicians in Taiwan. One afternoon, C3LL and I were hanging around for nothing. I pulled up my laptop and started making some drum loops, so we started jamming with C3LL's new synthesizer, minimoog and juno 60. Then hung- li came by and started playing bass line. Everything started after that. C3LL started hitting chords on juno and Layton jamming some guitar licks. For Layton, it was an amazing experience to collaborate with these talents and smooth flow during the creation.</p>",
