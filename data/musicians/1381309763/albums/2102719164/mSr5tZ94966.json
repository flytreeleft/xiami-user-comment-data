  "lyric": "There was a little alien named Beezer<br>\n<br>\nWho loved to dance and to play<br>\n<br>\nBut sometimes there was work to do<br>\nSo he scrubbed and he cleaned all day<br>\n<br>\nHe polished the rings around Saturn<br>\nAnd spackled the face of the moon<br>\nHe installed central heating on Pluto<br>\nIt took him all afternoon<br>\nHe air conditioned Mercury<br>\nAnd sharpened the dullest stars<br>\nHe took a meteor shower<br>\nThen dusted the planet Mars<br>\n<br>\nHe fluffed the clouds around Venus<br>\nAnd juggled Jupiter's moons<br>\nNow he'll paint a big smile on the Earth<br>\nAnd go rest in his outer space room<br>\n<br>\nPhew",
