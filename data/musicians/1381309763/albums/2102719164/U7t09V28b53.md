## 歌词

<div>
Well I'm not comin' back to Galapagos<br><br>
When it's time for my next vacation<br><br>
<br><br>
Cuz everyone is runnin' from some predator<br><br>
It's not a great place for relaxation<br><br>
<br><br>
You think you'll ring up room service for some grub<br><br>
They've got anchovies but no pizza<br><br>
Yeah it's a real pretty place and there's lots of space<br><br>
But I think iguana go to Disneyland instead<br><br>
<br><br>
There's a bunch of little islands way out in the sea<br><br>
And they're filled with amazing creatures<br><br>
<br><br>
Like the blue-footed boobies with their musical toots<br><br>
Or the baby iguanas watch 'em scamper and scoot<br><br>
But when you stretch out with a cold drink to catch some rays<br><br>
Don't be surprised if you get carried away<br><br>
Cuz there's lotsa volcanoes love to spray their goo<br><br>
Just make sure it doesn't land on you<br><br>
<br><br>
Well I'm not coming' back to galapagos<br><br>
When it's time for my next vacation<br><br>
<br><br>
Cuz everyone is runnin' from some predator<br><br>
It's not a great place for relaxation<br><br>
<br><br>
You think you'll ring up room service for some grub<br><br>
They've got anchovies but no pizza<br><br>
Yeah it's a real pretty place and there's lots of space<br><br>
But I think iguana go to disneyland instead<br><br>
<br><br>
If you're comin' here for science this is paradise<br><br>
Cuz there's no other place quite like it<br><br>
And if you're happy sleepin' in a tent it's extra nice<br><br>
Surely it's a bargain even twice the price<br><br>
But if you're used to vacationing at the Ritz<br><br>
Being waited on hand and foot while you sit<br><br>
I hope a penguin in tuxedo gets it done for you<br><br>
And you like chattin' with the sea lions lyin' 'round your pool<br><br>
<br><br>
Hey-o see the tide roll in<br><br>
Hey-o rollin' out again<br><br>
Hey-o sit down on that rock<br><br>
Hey-o whoa these rocks can walk<br><br>
Whaddaya doin' sittin' on that shell<br><br>
<br><br>
Get off that tortoise 'fore he rings your bell<br><br>
Well I'm not coming' back to galapagos<br><br>
When it's time for my next vacation<br><br>
<br><br>
Cuz everyone is runnin' from some predator<br><br>
It's not a great place for relaxation<br><br>
<br><br>
You think you'll ring up room service for some grub<br><br>
They've got anchovies but no pizza<br><br>
Yeah it's a real pretty place and there's lots of space<br><br>
But I think iguana go to disneyland instead<br><br>
<br><br>
Yeah it's a real pretty place and there's lots of space<br><br>
But I think iguana go to disneyland instead<br><br>
<br><br>
Yeah I think iguana go to disneyland
