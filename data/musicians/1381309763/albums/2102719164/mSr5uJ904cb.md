## 歌词

<div>
Jack and Jill went up the hill to fetch a pail of water<br><br>
<br><br>
Jack fell down and broke his crown<br><br>
And Jill came tumbling after<br><br>
<br><br>
Up Jack got and home did trot<br><br>
As fast as he could caper<br><br>
He went to bed and bound his head<br><br>
With vinegar and brown paper<br><br>
<br><br>
Jack and Jill went up the hill to fetch a pail of water<br><br>
Jack fell down and broke his crown<br><br>
And Jill came tumbling after
</div>
