## 歌词

<div>
Who turns purple when he's happy<br><br>
<br><br>
Who turns yellow when he's napping<br><br>
<br><br>
Who gets stripes in the bath<br><br>
Spots when he laughs<br><br>
<br><br>
Oh that's flynn the blynn<br><br>
<br><br>
Mommy says he's imaginary<br><br>
<br><br>
But I've seen him prancin' on the prarie<br><br>
<br><br>
Well you have to believe<br><br>
If you want to receive<br><br>
A glimpse of flynn the blynn<br><br>
<br><br>
Flynn flynn flynn the blynn<br><br>
<br><br>
He's an original<br><br>
And he is my friend<br><br>
Flynn flynn<br><br>
Flynn the blynn<br><br>
We love flynn the blynn<br><br>
<br><br>
Does flynn have a sister or a brother<br><br>
We wonder if there is another<br><br>
<br><br>
And what does he eat when he needs a treat<br><br>
Just who is flynn the blynn<br><br>
<br><br>
Flynn flynn flynn the blynn<br><br>
<br><br>
He's an original<br><br>
And he is my friend<br><br>
Flynn flynn<br><br>
Flynn the blynn<br><br>
We love flynn the blynn<br><br>
<br><br>
One day flynn was sad and crying<br><br>
He said nobody recognized me<br><br>
<br><br>
When he feels your fear<br><br>
<br><br>
He will disappear<br><br>
Whooosh there goes flynn the blynn<br><br>
<br><br>
Flynn flynn flynn the blynn<br><br>
He's an original<br><br>
And he is my friend<br><br>
Flynn flynn<br><br>
Flynn the blynn<br><br>
We love flynn the blynn<br><br>
<br><br>
Flynn flynn flynn the blynn<br><br>
<br><br>
He's an original<br><br>
And he is my friend<br><br>
Flynn flynn<br><br>
Flynn the blynn<br><br>
We love flynn the blynn<br><br>
<br><br>
Flynn flynn flynn the blynn<br><br>
We love flynn the blynn
