## 歌词

<div>
I saw a ship a-sailing<br><br>
A-sailing on the sea<br><br>
<br><br>
And oh it was all laden<br><br>
With pretty things for thee<br><br>
There were comfits in the cabin<br><br>
And apples in the hold<br><br>
<br><br>
The sails were made of silk<br><br>
And the masts were made of gold<br><br>
<br><br>
The four-and-twenty sailors<br><br>
That stood between the decks<br><br>
<br><br>
Were four-and-twenty white mice<br><br>
With chains about their necks<br><br>
<br><br>
The captain was a duck<br><br>
With a packet on his back<br><br>
<br><br>
And when the ship began to move<br><br>
The captain said quack quack
</div>
