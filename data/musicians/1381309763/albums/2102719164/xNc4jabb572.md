<div>
It's time for the hokey pokey here we go<br><br>
<br><br>
You put your head in you put your head out<br><br>
You put your head in and you wiggle wiggle wiggle<br><br>
<br><br>
You do the hokey pokey spin around clap clap clap clap<br><br>
<br><br>
We jump you put your ears in you put your ears out<br><br>
You put your ears in and you wiggle wiggle wiggle<br><br>
<br><br>
You do the hokey pokey spin around clap clap clap clap<br><br>
Alright do the hokey pokey hands up hands down<br><br>
<br><br>
Do the ho hokey hokey pokey hands in front hands behind<br><br>
<br><br>
Jump in jump out jump in and wiggle wiggle wiggle<br><br>
Do the hokey pokey spin around clap clap clap clap<br><br>
OK now your hands put your hands in put your hands out<br><br>
Put your hands in and wiggle wiggle wiggle<br><br>

Alright let's first put your knees in put your knees out<br><br>
Put your knees in and wiggle wiggle wiggle<br><br>

Put your feet in put your feet out<br><br>
Put your feet in and wiggle wiggle wiggle<br><br>
