## 歌词

<div>
There was a little alien named Beezer<br><br>
<br><br>
Who loved to dance and to play<br><br>
<br><br>
But sometimes there was work to do<br><br>
So he scrubbed and he cleaned all day<br><br>
<br><br>
He polished the rings around Saturn<br><br>
And spackled the face of the moon<br><br>
He installed central heating on Pluto<br><br>
It took him all afternoon<br><br>
He air conditioned Mercury<br><br>
And sharpened the dullest stars<br><br>
He took a meteor shower<br><br>
Then dusted the planet Mars<br><br>
<br><br>
He fluffed the clouds around Venus<br><br>
And juggled Jupiter's moons<br><br>
Now he'll paint a big smile on the Earth<br><br>
And go rest in his outer space room<br><br>
<br><br>
Phew
</div>
