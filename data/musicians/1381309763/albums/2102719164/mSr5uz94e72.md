## 歌词

<div>
Insects are everywhere<br><br>
Just look and see<br><br>
Underneath the rocks<br><br>
Climbing up the trees<br><br>
Just look in your garden<br><br>
Or in your front yard<br><br>
You should really have to look very hard<br><br>
Lady bugs grasshopper bumble bees<br><br>
Out of long branches munching up some leaves<br><br>
Beetles crickets sting bugs too<br><br>
Leaf hopper zarmy are just a name of few<br><br>
There are millions of ants<br><br>
And they're hard at work<br><br>
Digging their tunnels under the earth<br><br>
Looking for a picnic or just a bit of food<br><br>
Or just a few crumbs left over from you<br><br>
Oh when they find it they think it's really great<br><br>
One little ant can carry twice his weight<br><br>
Bring the food back to the colony<br><br>
Where all those ants have just one queen<br><br>
Caterpillar slowly inching by<br><br>
One day she hopes to be a butterfly<br><br>
When she finds a spot with just enough groom<br><br>
She goes to work on her cocoon<br><br>
Caterpillar sleeping dreaming now<br><br>
On about flowers and flying around<br><br>
Out of the chrysalis ready to fly<br><br>
That's how caterpillars become butterflies<br><br>
Insects are everywhere<br><br>
Just look and see<br><br>
Underneath the rocks<br><br>
Climbing up the trees<br><br>
Look in your garden<br><br>
Or in your front yard<br><br>
You should really have to look very hard
