## 歌词

<div>
Written by：Sally Mary Seltmann/Leslie Feist<br><br>
<br><br>
One two three four<br><br>
Tell me that you love me more<br><br>
Sleepless long nights<br><br>
That is what my youth was for<br><br>
Old teenage hopes are alive at your door<br><br>
Left you with nothing but they want some more<br><br>
Oh you're changing your heart<br><br>
Oh you know who you are<br><br>
<br><br>
Sweetheart bitterheart now I can't tell me apart<br><br>
Cozy and cold put the horse before the cart<br><br>
Those teenage hopes who have tears in their eyes<br><br>
Too scared to own up to one little lie<br><br>
Oh you're changing your heart<br><br>
<br><br>
Oh you know who you are<br><br>
<br><br>
One two three four five six nine or ten<br><br>
Money can't buy you back the love that you had then<br><br>
<br><br>
One two three four five six nine or ten<br><br>
Money can't buy you back the love that you had then<br><br>
<br><br>
Oh you're changing your heart<br><br>
<br><br>
Oh you know who you are<br><br>
<br><br>
Oh you're changing your heart<br><br>
<br><br>
Oh you know who you are<br><br>
<br><br>
Who you are who you
