## 歌词

<div>
Once there was a cat named nick<br><br>
Tickled everybody with a hickery stick<br><br>
When you try to catch him he will run away quick<br><br>
He was a quick trick cat<br><br>
<br><br>
Once there was a fly named steeve<br><br>
He zipped up his shoulder and<br><br>
He wiped it on his sleeve<br><br>
Then he go and hide behind<br><br>
A big old leaf<br><br>
He was a dry sly fly<br><br>
<br><br>
Once there was a mule named marty<br><br>
The mocker made him pull around<br><br>
The big head mccartney he said<br><br>
The teacher couldn't invite him<br><br>
To my class room party<br><br>
He was a cool school mule<br><br>
<br><br>
Once there was a hog named charlie<br><br>
He took the cool spin on his poor<br><br>
Dressed harley<br><br>
He drove me to my car which then my hair<br><br>
Got starry<br><br>
He was a boggy soggy hoggy<br><br>
<br><br>
Once there was a duck named hetty<br><br>
Put butter on my steak and then<br><br>
Jumped in to my spaghetti<br><br>
And then he had a treat because the meat balls<br><br>
Were ready he was a lucky luck ducky<br><br>
<br><br>
Once there was a funny song<br><br>
That everybody laughed and giggled all day long<br><br>
Time is now right for me to say so long<br><br>
I'll be soon to end up too<br><br>
It's a funny song<br><br>
And it didn't take long<br><br>
Come on and sing along<br><br>
It's a funny song
</div>
