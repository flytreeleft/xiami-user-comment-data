## 歌词

<div>
Oats peas beans and barley grow<br><br>
Oats peas beans and barley grow<br><br>
Can you or I or anyone know<br><br>
How oats peas beans and barley grow<br><br>
First the farmer sows his seed<br><br>
Stands erect and takes his ease<br><br>
He stamps his foot and claps his hands<br><br>
And turns around to view his lands<br><br>
Oats peas beans and barley grow<br><br>
Oats peas beans and barley grow<br><br>
Can you or I or anyone know<br><br>
How oats peas beans and barley grow<br><br>
<br><br>
Next the farmer waters the seed<br><br>
Stands erect and takes his ease<br><br>
He stamps his foot and claps his hands<br><br>
And turns around to view his lands<br><br>
Oats peas beans and barley grow<br><br>
Oats peas beans and barley grow<br><br>
Can you or I or anyone know<br><br>
How oats peas beans and barley grow<br><br>
Next the farmer hoes the weeds<br><br>
Stands erect and takes his ease<br><br>
He stamps his foot and claps his hands<br><br>
And turns around to view his lands<br><br>
Oats peas beans and barley grow<br><br>
Oats peas beans and barley grow<br><br>
Can you or I or anyone know<br><br>
How oats peas beans and barley grow<br><br>
Last the farmer harvests his seed<br><br>
Stands erect and takes his ease<br><br>
He stamps his foot and claps his hands<br><br>
And turns around to view his lands
