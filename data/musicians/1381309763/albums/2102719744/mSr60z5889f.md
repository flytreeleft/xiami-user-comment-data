## 歌词

<div>
Got a new friend<br><br>
I got the most amazing pet<br><br>
I'm not sure how I never gotta get him to the vet<br><br>
He's green and he's purple and he's not very furry<br><br>
At all<br><br>
He's really good in running and he's great at catching<br><br>
When I throw the ball<br><br>
I've got a pet dinosaur<br><br>
Drowing everyday<br><br>
Last monthly he's the size of my hand<br><br>
He's even bigger today<br><br>
My pet dinosaur he's my bestfriend and my counter dance<br><br>
With just one look in his eyes I always know<br><br>
Just what he wants<br><br>
We go to the park each day<br><br>
To play catch<br><br>
In the sun<br><br>
People scared<br><br>
People scream<br><br>
Shouldn't smile<br><br>
And grown upfront<br><br>
I've got a pet dinosaur<br><br>
Growing everyday<br><br>
Last monthly he's the size of my bed<br><br>
But he's even bigger today<br><br>
The first I'm run home and ask mom and dad<br><br>
If he could stay<br><br>
Well I can see in their eyes<br><br>
They didn't quite know what to say<br><br>
He wasn't I think and I can't think we was frigtened<br><br>
At all<br><br>
Whoever know he grow up to mistletoe<br><br>
I've got a pet dinosaur<br><br>
Growing everyday<br><br>
Three days ago he was the size of my room<br><br>
But even bigger today<br><br>
When we was young<br><br>
Teach you on the bit of the couch<br><br>
Ocassionally you had an accident on the floor<br><br>
And forgot to put him out<br><br>
2000 paper towels and 2 tons on losing paper liner<br><br>
I'm happy to say self broken<br><br>
But he looks away on the neighbor<br><br>
I've got a pet dinosaur<br><br>
Growing everyday<br><br>
Yesterday he's the size of my house<br><br>
But he's even bigger today<br><br>
I've got a pet dinosaur<br><br>
Growing everyday<br><br>
Today he's the size of my block<br><br>
I never imagine what he will be next may
