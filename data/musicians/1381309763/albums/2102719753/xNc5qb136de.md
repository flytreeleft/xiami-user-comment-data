## 歌词

<div>
Sing a song of sixpence<br><br>
A pocket full of rye<br><br>
<br><br>
Four and twenty blackbirds<br><br>
Baked in a pie<br><br>
<br><br>
When the pie was opened<br><br>
The birds began to sing<br><br>
<br><br>
Wasn't that a dainty dish<br><br>
To set before a king<br><br>
The king was in the counting house<br><br>
Counting out his money<br><br>
<br><br>
The queen was in the parlor<br><br>
Eating bread and honey<br><br>
The maid was in the garden<br><br>
Hanging out the clothes<br><br>
When along came a blackbird<br><br>
And landed on her nose
</div>
