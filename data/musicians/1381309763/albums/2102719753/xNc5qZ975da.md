## 歌词

<div>
The north wind doth blow<br><br>
And we shall have snow<br><br>
And what will poor robing do then<br><br>
Poorthing<br><br>
He'll sit in the barn and keep himself warm<br><br>
And hide his head under his wing<br><br>
Poorthing<br><br>
<br><br>
The north wind doth blow<br><br>
And we shall have snow<br><br>
And what will poor robing do then<br><br>
Poorthing<br><br>
He'll sit in the barn and keep himself warm<br><br>
And hide his head under his wing<br><br>
Poorthing
</div>
