## 歌词

<div>
There was an old woman tossed up in a basket<br><br>
Nineteen times as high as the moon<br><br>
<br><br>
Where she was going I couldn't but ask it<br><br>
For in her hand she carried a broom<br><br>
Old woman old woman old woman quoth I<br><br>
<br><br>
Where are you going to up so high<br><br>
To brush the cobwebs off the sky<br><br>
May I go with thee aye by and by<br><br>
<br><br>
Old woman old woman old woman quoth I<br><br>
Where are you going to up so high<br><br>
To brush the cobwebs off the sky<br><br>
May I go with thee aye by and by
</div>
