  "lyric": "There's a monster in my house I hear it every night<br>\n<br>\nIt sounds like it has big sharp claws and nasty fangs that bite<br>\n<br>\nThere's a monster in my house it makes it hard to sleep<br>\n<br>\nI hear it growling on and on in a voice so scary and deep<br>\nIt sounds was<br>\nZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz<br>\n<br>\nThere's a monster in my house<br>\n<br>\nAnd it's coming after me<br>\n<br>\nThere's a monster in my house<br>\n<br>\nThere's a monster in my house I shake and scream with fear<br>\n<br>\nMy mom and dad come running in but suddenly there's nothing to hear<br>\n<br>\nSo they go back to their room and leave me all alone<br>\n<br>\nBut soon enough that sound is back that chills me to the bone<br>\n<br>\nZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz<br>\n<br>\nThere's a monster in my house<br>\n<br>\nAnd it's coming after me<br>\n<br>\nThere's a monster in my house<br>\n<br>\nNow the time has come to face that monster once and for all<br>\n<br>\nArmed with a high powered squirt gun I creep out into the hall<br>\n<br>\nI listen hard to follow the noise but soon I'm filled with gloom<br>\n<br>\nFor the monster's sound is coming from within my parents room<br>\n<br>\nI slink inside the door and see a big lump on the bed<br>\n<br>\nI shoot a stream of water and it soaks the monster's head<br>\n<br>\nThe lights come on as the monster wakes and boy is it ever mad<br>\n<br>\nI guess I should have realized that the monster's just my dad<br>\n<br>\nOops<br>\n<br>\nThere's a monster in my house<br>\n<br>\nNow he's going back to sleep<br>\n<br>\nThere's a monster in my house<br>\n<br>\nZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz dad",
