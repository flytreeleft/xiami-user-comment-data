## 歌词

<div>
Well it's a hard life<br><br>
<br><br>
When there's nothin' to do<br><br>
And it's a sad life<br><br>
<br><br>
When there's no one to talk to<br><br>
No music to dance to<br><br>
And I can't go out<br><br>
There's not even an audience<br><br>
To watch me pout<br><br>
I've got the time out blues<br><br>
<br><br>
Yeah the time out blues<br><br>
<br><br>
Just sittin' and mopin' on the edge of my bed<br><br>
<br><br>
What was I thinkin' what got into my head<br><br>
<br><br>
When I popped off smart talked threw a little tantrum<br><br>
Now I've lost it all I'm sittin' here sulkin' with the time out blues<br><br>
<br><br>
It was a small toy<br><br>
<br><br>
But it caught my eye<br><br>
A very small toy<br><br>
<br><br>
But it grew big in my mind<br><br>
<br><br>
Was it worth fightin' over<br><br>
Worth grabbin away<br><br>
<br><br>
Just couldn't be patient<br><br>
I just wanted to play<br><br>
Now I've got the time out blues<br><br>
<br><br>
Yeah the time out blues<br><br>
<br><br>
Just sittin' and mopin' on the edge of my bed<br><br>
<br><br>
What was I thinkin' what got into my head<br><br>
<br><br>
When I popped off smart talked threw a little tantrum<br><br>
Now I've lost it all I'm sittin' here sulkin' with the time out blues<br><br>
<br><br>
Can't run can't play can't talk on the phone<br><br>
I'm bored to tears I'm like a dog without his bone<br><br>
I've got the time out blues<br><br>
<br><br>
Yeah the time out blues<br><br>
<br><br>
Just sittin' and mopin' on the edge of my bed<br><br>
<br><br>
What was I thinkin' what got into my head<br><br>
<br><br>
When I popped off smart talked threw a little tantrum<br><br>
Now I've lost it all I'm sittin' here sulkin' with the time out blues
