<div>
The ants go marching one by one hurrah hurrah<br><br>
The ants go marching one by one hurrah hurrah<br><br>
The ants go marching one by one<br><br>
The little one stops to suck his thumb<br><br>
And they all go marching down to the ground<br><br>
To get out of the rain boom boom boom boom boom boom boom<br><br>
The ants go marching two by two hurrah hurrah<br><br>
The ants go marching two by two hurrah hurrah<br><br>
The ants go marching two by two<br><br>
The little one stops to tie his shoe<br><br>
And they all go marching down to the ground<br><br>
To get out of the rain boom boom boom boom boom boom boom<br><br>
The ants go marching three by three hurrah hurrah<br><br>
The ants go marching three by three hurrah hurrah<br><br>
The ants go marching three by three<br><br>
The little one stops to climb a tree<br><br>
And they all go marching down to the ground<br><br>
<br><br>
To get out of the rain boom boom boom boom boom boom boom<br><br>
The ants go marching four by four hurrah hurrah<br><br>
The ants go marching four by four hurrah hurrah<br><br>
The ants go marching four by four<br><br>
The little one stops to shut the door<br><br>
<br><br>
To get out of the rain boom boom boom boom boom boom boom<br><br>
The ants go marching five by five hurrah hurrah<br><br>
The ants go marching five by five hurrah hurrah<br><br>
The ants go marching five by five<br><br>
The little one stops to take a dive<br><br>
And they all go marching down to the ground<br><br>
To get out of the rain<br><br>
<br><br>
The ants go marching six by six hurrah hurrah<br><br>
The ants go marching six by six hurrah hurrah<br><br>
The ants go marching six by six<br><br>
The little one stops to pick up sticks<br><br>
And they all go marching down to the ground<br><br>
To get out of the rain boom boom boom boom boom boom boom<br><br>
The ants go marching seven by seven hurrah hurrah<br><br>
The ants go marching seven by seven hurrah hurrah<br><br>
The ants go marching seven by seven<br><br>
The little one stops to pray to heaven<br><br>
<br><br>
And they all go marching down to the ground<br><br>
To get out of the rain boom boom boom boom boom boom boom<br><br>
The ants go marching eight by eight hurrah hurrah<br><br>
The ants go marching eight by eight hurrah hurrah<br><br>
The ants go marching eight by eight<br><br>
The little one stops to roller skate<br><br>
And they all go marching down to the ground<br><br>
To get out of the rain boom boom boom boom boom boom boom<br><br>
The ants go marching nine by nine hurrah hurrah<br><br>
The ants go marching nine by nine hurrah hurrah<br><br>
The ants go marching nine by nine<br><br>
The little one stops to check the time<br><br>
And they all go marching down to the ground<br><br>
To get out of the rain boom boom boom boom boom boom boom<br><br>
The ants go marching ten by ten hurrah hurrah<br><br>
The ants go marching ten by ten hurrah hurrah<br><br>
The ants go marching ten by ten<br><br>
The little one stops to shout the end<br><br>
And they all go marching down to the ground<br><br>
To get out of the rain boom boom boom boom boom boom boom
