  "profile": "French Kiwi Juice，简称FKJ更出名，擅长复杂、流畅的电子乐。 \n\n Futuristically Classy, French Kiwi Juice. Better known by the abbreviation FKJ, has mastered the sound of sophisticatedly, smooth electronic music. With serene sounds perfect for posh settings, FKJ with his strong catalogue of tracks has found himself on repeat in the dwellings of all Roche Musique alumni. Lying together his first track to hit the charts is built off of a mellow, heartfelt sample, and leyered with classic electronic keyboards, and a beautiful guitar bass. This is music that you can groove to, youth tested and elder approved. Be on the lookout for more music from FKJ at Roche Musique. He is definitely an artist that deserves a spotlight."
