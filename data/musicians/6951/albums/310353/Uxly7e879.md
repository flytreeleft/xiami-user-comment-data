## 歌词

<div>
It was just the kind of thought I needed, couldn't give it up even for a laugh<br><br>
And i would better be in need, but I got it all wrong, I got it all wrong,<br><br>
until we talked<br><br>
It's just the kind of thought they need<br><br>
You were just the kind of thought I needed, couldn't give it up even for a drink<br><br>
And I thought of other plans to seek, but I got it wrong, I got it all wrong, until we talked<br><br>
<br><br>
I wanna hear scream my name dadada...like a spell to get out of nowhere<br><br>
Come up now like a bright pink fairy tale, they don't fade away<br><br>
<br><br>
×2<br><br>
<br><br>
Couldn't give it up even or a laugh<br><br>
And I though of other places to be, like Sri Lanka, London all the way to<br><br>
India, touch the golded ground of Istanbul, everywhere with you<br><br>
<br><br>
I wanna hear scream my name dadada...like a spell to get out of nowhere<br><br>
Come up now like a bright pink fairy tale, they don't fade away<br><br>
<br><br>
It was just the kind of thought I needed, couldn't give it up even for a laugh<br><br>
And i would better be in need, so give it up, so they can see, they can see<br><br>
until you know...<br><br>
<br><br>
I wanna hear scream my name dadada...like a spell to get out of nowhere<br><br>
Come up now like a bright pink fairy tale, they don't fade away
