<div>
a bowl of rice    词/shunza  曲/shunza &amp; joe<br><br>
takin' my little voyage again.<br><br>
thinkin' back into my childhood land.<br><br>
drinkin' the white milk she forced me to.<br><br>
hershey's chocolate syrup on sundays,too.<br><br>
pourin'tasteless white milk into the sink.<br><br>
hopin' that grandma didnt see me doin' it.<br><br>
couldnt drink nothin' without color in it.<br><br>
hatin' colorless society and provin' it.<br><br>
watching too much t.v for a chinese girl.<br><br>
living in a new country called america.<br><br>
yes she's beautiful,she's got her spacious skies.<br><br>
but what about the ugly parts the conquerors hide?<br><br>
a bowl of rice is a bowl of memories.<br><br>
shovin' it down our hungry throats.<br><br>
a cup of tea is a cup of tears.<br><br>
floodin down our thirsty throats.<br><br>
so i write a song to keep.<br><br>
the memories of you and me.<br><br>
it shall keep us warm at night.<br><br>
even though you're out of sight .<br><br>
being hit in first grade by a little black girl.<br><br>
i knew she felt trapped in her unjust world.<br><br>
she needed someone to beat<br><br>
because she too was being beat.<br><br>
by the same society i learned later dreaded me..<br><br>
the eyelinei was blessed with made me feel superior.<br><br>
watchin'sisters slice up theirs.who felt inferior?<br><br>
things are not the same when the east meets the west.<br><br>
a foggy glimpse is what they got of 美国 beautiful west.<br><br>
a bowl of rice is a bowl of memories.<br><br>
shovin it down our hungry throats.<br><br>
a cup of tea is a cup of tears.<br><br>
floodin down our thirsty throats.<br><br>
so i write a song to keep.<br><br>
the memories of you and me.<br><br>
it shall keep us warm at night.<br><br>
even though you're out of sight .<br><br>
a bowl of rice is a bowl of memories.<br><br>
shovin'it down our hungry throats.<br><br>
a cup of tea is a cup of tears.<br><br>
floodin down our thirsty throats.<br><br>
so i write a song to keep.<br><br>
the memories of you and me.<br><br>
it shall keep us warm at night.<br><br>
even though you're out of sight .
