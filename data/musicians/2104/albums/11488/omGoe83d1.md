## 歌词

<div>
（Mama said not to regret<br><br>
Just don‘t get, don‘t get upset<br><br>
Mama said not to regret　　　）<br><br>
<br><br>
You think that you need all these men in your life<br><br>
What you don‘t know is that you‘re free to be by yourself and happy<br><br>
It seems you‘re incomplete untill Mr.Right comes along<br><br>
What you can‘t see is that he‘s gone<br><br>
Mr.Wrong took your song<br><br>
<br><br>
You seemed so happy <br><br>
When you were in total control of your life, of your soul<br><br>
of your everyday goals<br><br>
Do not let go, no, don‘t let go<br><br>
<br><br>
Don‘t you let nobody run your life<br><br>
You go on, girl, and find Mr.Right<br><br>
There‘s so much to go for in this life<br><br>
Just believe in yourself, it‘s alright<br><br>
<br><br>
（Mama said not to regret）<br><br>
<br><br>
You know that you‘re strong<br><br>
'Cause can‘t nobody take it all<br><br>
You just go on and sing your song(la,la,la)<br><br>
‘Cause you don‘t need no Mr.Wrong<br><br>
<br><br>
You seemed so happy(before) <br><br>
When you were in total control of your life, of your soul<br><br>
of your everyday goals<br><br>
Do not let go, no, don‘t let go<br><br>
<br><br>
Don‘t you let nobody run your life<br><br>
You go on,girl, and find Mr.Right<br><br>
There‘s so much to go for in this life<br><br>
Just believe in yourself, it‘s alright<br><br>
<br><br>
Don‘t you let nobody run your life<br><br>
You go on,girl, and find Mr.Right<br><br>
There‘s so much to go for in this life<br><br>
Just believe in yourself, it‘s alright<br><br>
<br><br>
You meet Mr.Wrong at all, at all the right times<br><br>
But you meet mister, Mr.Right at all the wrong times<br><br>
<br><br>
【 Rap 】<br><br>
Tellin‘ me things like you can not do without a man in you life<br><br>
Oh boo-hoo-hoo!(Hahaha!)<br><br>
Where was he when you needed him most?<br><br>
All the lies and "I‘ll try."s ain‘t good to go<br><br>
Find a better man<br><br>
Get out there, find a better plan<br><br>
PlanA didn‘t stick, planB damn week<br><br>
"C" seeing is believing<br><br>
He took your song and carried along his own walkman of stunts<br><br>
Straight out of the town on another long and busy day<br><br>
Getting laid, getting paid, better move away<br><br>
From your face, this very day<br><br>
You got things to do, ain‘t got shit to pay<br><br>
Nobody tells you what to say<br><br>
Get up, girl, stand up, girl, sing<br><br>
<br><br>
Don‘t you let nobody run your life<br><br>
You go on,girl, and find Mr.Right<br><br>
There‘s so much to go for in this life<br><br>
Just believe in yourself, it‘s alright<br><br>
<br><br>
Don‘t you let nobody run your life<br><br>
You go on,girl, and find Mr.Right<br><br>
Lalalalalalala...<br><br>
<br><br>
（Mama said not to regret<br><br>
Just don‘t get, don‘t get upset<br><br>
Mama said not to regret<br><br>
Mama said not to regret　　　）
