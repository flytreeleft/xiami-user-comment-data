## 歌词

<div>
don't cry out loud<br><br>
baby cried the day the circus came to town<br><br>
cause she didn't wan't parades just passing by her<br><br>
so she painted on a smile and took up with some clown<br><br>
while she danced without a net upon the wire<br><br>
i know a lot about her, cause you'll see<br><br>
baby is an awful lot like me<br><br>
don't cry out loud<br><br>
just keep it inside<br><br>
and learn how to hide your<br><br>
fly high and proud<br><br>
and if you should fall<br><br>
remember you almost had it<br><br>
baby saw that when they pulled the big top down<br><br>
they left behind her dreams among the litter<br><br>
and the different kind of love she thought she'd found<br><br>
there was nothing left but sawdust and some glitter<br><br>
but baby can't be broken cause you see<br><br>
she had the finest teacher, that was me<br><br>
i told her<br><br>
