## 歌词

<div>
I'm tired of playing on the team<br><br>
Ooh it seems I don't get time out anymore ooh<br><br>
Ooh, I-d-a-change if we set the pace face to face<br><br>
No, I won't even try to score oh<br><br>
<br><br>
And oh, oh I can feel the magic of your touch<br><br>
Mm and when you move in close a little bit means so much<br><br>
And ooh yeah, you've got to understand baby<br><br>
Time out is what I'm here for oh oh<br><br>
<br><br>
One on one, I wanna play that game tonight<br><br>
One on one I know, I wanna play that<br><br>
One on one I wanna play that game tonight<br><br>
One on one so slow ooh<br><br>
<br><br>
Ooh, you can't tell me you don't miss me boy<br><br>
No I think I might know you too well<br><br>
I'd do say if you knew that I was coming tonight<br><br>
I want you, can't you tell, ooh<br><br>
<br><br>
One on one, I wanna play that game tonight<br><br>
One on one I know, I wanna play that<br><br>
One on one I wanna play that game tonight<br><br>
One on one so slow ooh<br><br>
<br><br>
That's all you need to know now'<br><br>
Oh if it's really right<br><br>
There's nothing else'rnmh<br><br>
<br><br>
One on one I wanna play that game tonight<br><br>
One on one I wanna play that game tonight<br><br>
<br><br>
Ooh, I don't want no one else<br><br>
I'm tired of playing' don't wannaplay those games no more,<br><br>
no more and when you move in close<br><br>
A little bit means so much
