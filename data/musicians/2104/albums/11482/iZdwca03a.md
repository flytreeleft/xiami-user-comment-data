A Song For You<br><br>
<br><br>
I've been so many places in my life and time<br><br>
I've sung a lot of songs, I've made some bad rhyme<br><br>
I've acted out my life in stages<br><br>
With ten thousand people watching<br><br>
But we're alone now and I'm singing this song for you<br><br>
<br><br>
I know your image of me is what I hope to be<br><br>
I've treated you unkindly, but baby, can't you see<br><br>
There's no one more important to me<br><br>
Baby can't you please see through me<br><br>
Cause we're alone now and I'm singing the song for you<br><br>
<br><br>
You taught me precious secrets<br><br>
The truth with holding nothing<br><br>
You came out in front and I was hiding<br><br>
Now I'm so much better<br><br>
If my words don't come together<br><br>
Listen to the melody cause my love's in there hiding<br><br>
<br><br>
I love you in a place where there is no space or time<br><br>
I love you for my life, cause you're a friend of mine<br><br>
And when my life is over, remember when we were together<br><br>
We were alone and I was singing the song for you<br><br>
<br><br>
You taught me precious secrets<br><br>
The truth with holding nothing<br><br>
You came out in front and I was hiding<br><br>
Now I'm so much better<br><br>
If my words don't come together<br><br>
Listen to the melody cause my love's in there hiding<br><br>
I love you in a place where there is no space or time<br><br>
I love you for my life, cause you're a friend of mine<br><br>
When my life is over, remember when we were together<br><br>
We were alone and I was singing the song for you<br><br>
We were alone and I was singing the song for you<br><br>
singing the song, singing the song,singing the song...
