## 歌词

<div>
I waited 'til I saw the sun<br><br>
I don't know why I didn't come<br><br>
I left you by the house of fun<br><br>
I don't know why I didn't come<br><br>
I don't know why I didn't come<br><br>
<br><br>
When I saw the break of day<br><br>
I wished that I could fly away<br><br>
Instead of kneeling in the sand<br><br>
Catching teardrops in my hand<br><br>
<br><br>
My heart is drenched in wine<br><br>
But you'll be on my mind<br><br>
Forever<br><br>
<br><br>
Out across the endless sea<br><br>
I would die in ecstasy<br><br>
But I'll be a bag of bones<br><br>
Driving down the road along<br><br>
<br><br>
My heart is drenched in wine<br><br>
But you'll be on my mind<br><br>
Forever<br><br>
<br><br>
Something has to make you run<br><br>
I don't know why I didn't come<br><br>
I feel as empty as a drum<br><br>
I don't know why I didn't come<br><br>
I don't know why I didn't come<br><br>
I don't know why I didn't come
</div>
