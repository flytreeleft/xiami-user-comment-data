<div>
A BOWL OF RICE    词/SHUNZA  曲/SHUNZA &amp; JOE<br><br>
TAKIN' MY LITTLE VOYAGE AGAIN.<br><br>
THINKIN' BACK INTO MY CHILDHOOD LAND.<br><br>
DRINKIN' THE WHITE MILK SHE FORCED ME TO.<br><br>
HERSHEY'S CHOCOLATE SYRUP ON SUNDAYS,TOO.<br><br>
POURIN'TASTELESS WHITE MILK INTO THE SINK.<br><br>
HOPIN' THAT GRANDMA DIDNT SEE ME DOIN' IT.<br><br>
COULDNT DRINK NOTHIN' WITHOUT COLOR IN IT.<br><br>
HATIN' COLORLESS SOCIETY AND PROVIN' IT.<br><br>
WATCHING TOO MUCH T.V FOR A CHINESE GIRL.<br><br>
LIVING IN A NEW COUNTRY CALLED AMERICA.<br><br>
YES SHE'S BEAUTIFUL,SHE'S GOT HER SPACIOUS SKIES.<br><br>
BUT WHAT ABOUT THE UGLY PARTS THE CONQUERORS HIDE?<br><br>
A BOWL OF RICE IS A BOWL OF MEMORIES.<br><br>
SHOVIN' IT DOWN OUR HUNGRY THROATS.<br><br>
A CUP OF TEA IS A CUP OF TEARS.<br><br>
FLOODIN DOWN OUR THIRSTY THROATS.<br><br>
SO I WRITE A SONG TO KEEP.<br><br>
THE MEMORIES OF YOU AND ME.<br><br>
IT SHALL KEEP US WARM AT NIGHT.<br><br>
EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE OUT OF SIGHT .<br><br>
BEING HIT IN FIRST GRADE BY A LITTLE BLACK GIRL.<br><br>
I KNEW SHE FELT TRAPPED IN HER UNJUST WORLD.<br><br>
SHE NEEDED SOMEONE TO BEAT<br><br>
BECAUSE SHE TOO WAS BEING BEAT.<br><br>
BY THE SAME SOCIETY I LEARNED LATER DREADED ME..<br><br>
THE EYELINEI WAS BLESSED WITH MADE ME FEEL SUPERIOR.<br><br>
WATCHIN'SISTERS SLICE UP THEIRS.WHO FELT INFERIOR?<br><br>
THINGS ARE NOT THE SAME WHEN THE EAST MEETS THE WEST.<br><br>
A FOGGY GLIMPSE IS WHAT THEY GOT OF 美国 BEAUTIFUL WEST.<br><br>
A BOWL OF RICE IS A BOWL OF MEMORIES.<br><br>
SHOVIN IT DOWN OUR HUNGRY THROATS.<br><br>
A CUP OF TEA IS A CUP OF TEARS.<br><br>
FLOODIN DOWN OUR THIRSTY THROATS.<br><br>
SO I WRITE A SONG TO KEEP.<br><br>
THE MEMORIES OF YOU AND ME.<br><br>
IT SHALL KEEP US WARM AT NIGHT.<br><br>
EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE OUT OF SIGHT .<br><br>
A BOWL OF RICE IS A BOWL OF MEMORIES.<br><br>
SHOVIN'IT DOWN OUR HUNGRY THROATS.<br><br>
A CUP OF TEA IS A CUP OF TEARS.<br><br>
FLOODIN DOWN OUR THIRSTY THROATS.<br><br>
SO I WRITE A SONG TO KEEP.<br><br>
THE MEMORIES OF YOU AND ME.<br><br>
IT SHALL KEEP US WARM AT NIGHT.<br><br>
EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE OUT OF SIGHT .
