CAN'T GET ENOUGH    词/SHUNZA  曲/SHUNZA &amp; YORGOS BENARDOS<br><br>
I JUST WANT TO TOUCH YOU HERE.<br><br>
I WANNA TOUCH YOU THERE.<br><br>
I JUST WANT TO TOUCH YOU EVERYWHERE IT GOES.<br><br>
I JUST WANT TO MAKE SOME TIME.<br><br>
CAN'T YOU UNDERSTAND MY RHYME?<br><br>
I JUST WANT TO MAKE SOME LOVE AND SOME BABIES.<br><br>
OH, I CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF YOU!<br><br>
I JUST CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF YOU!<br><br>
OH, I CANT GET ENOUGH OF YOU!<br><br>
I JUST CANT GET ENOUGH OF YOU!<br><br>
(music)<br><br>
I JUST WANT TO TOUCH YOU HERE.<br><br>
I WANNA TOUCH YOU THERE.<br><br>
I JUST WANT TO TOUCH YOU EVERYWHERE IT GOES.<br><br>
I JUST WANT TO MAKE SOME TIME.<br><br>
CAN'T YOU UNDERSTAND MY RHYME?<br><br>
I JUST WANT TO MAKE SOME LOVE AND SOME BABIES.<br><br>
OH, I CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF YOU!<br><br>
I JUST CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF YOU!<br><br>
OH, I CANT GET ENOUGH OF YOU!<br><br>
I JUST CANT GET ENOUGH OF YOU!<br><br>
SINCE YOU'VE BEEN SEEIN' ME AROUND THE BLOCK.<br><br>
I GOTTA LET YA KNOW.I GOTTA LET YA KNOW , DOC,<br><br>
THAT YOU'RE THE FINEST THANG I NOTICED IN A LONG TIME.<br><br>
I WAS THINKIN' MAYBE YOU AND I COULD GET ON JUST FINE.<br><br>
TOGETHER IN THE GOOD WEATHER, PERHAPS WE BETTER.<br><br>
GET TOGETHER AND MAKE IT MATTER.<br><br>
DADDY-YO,DONT YA GO.MISS THE SHOW,LET ME KNOW .<br><br>
FEEL THE BUTTERFLIES IN MY STOMACH GO.YO-YO!<br><br>
SINCE I'M THE NEW GIRL AROUND THE BLOCK.<br><br>
THE KANGOL KID AND ESPECIALLY DOC.<br><br>
WOULD LIKE TO SLEEP WITH ME IF HE CAN.<br><br>
BUT YOU'RE JUST A BOY,YOU'RE NOT EVEN A MAN!<br><br>
I'M BACK AGAIN AND THIS TIME I GOTTA LET IT GO.<br><br>
LET THE RAIN SLIDE DOWN MY  BACK AND MAKE A RAINBOW.<br><br>
DO YOU SEE THE SEVEN COLORS OF MY <arc.en-ciel?><br><br>
I BETCHA FIVE DOLLARS I'M-A-MAKE YOU YELL.<br><br>
THEN SCREAM WITH PLEASURE AT YOUR EVERY MOVE.<br><br>
CONTRACTIONS ON THE TWO-AND-FOUR OF THIS GROOVE.<br><br>
REPETITIONS OF THE FACT THAT I CANT GET ENOUGH.<br><br>
I'M GONNA OOZE MY LOVE IN YOU!<br><br>
OH,I CANT GET ENOUGH OF YOU!<br><br>
I JUST CANT GET ENOUGH OF YOU!<br><br>
OH,I CANT GET ENOUGH OF YOU!<br><br>
I JUST CANT GET ENOUGH OF YOU!<br><br>
<br><br>
Welcome to /lyrics<br>
</arc.en-ciel?>
