## 简介

<div>
"Unclear Sky," is a four song pre-album teaser of newly recorded, previously unreleased and fan-fav tunes from emerging singer-songwriter Joshua Radin. Opening tune "Sky" is used as background music in Grey's Anatomy Season 4 episode 15. It's a plaintive acoustic-flavored duet featuring the Staten Island indie pop performer Ingrid Michaelson. <br><br>
About the artist: <br><br>
Joshua Radin is a native of Cleveland, Ohio who began his artistic pursuits at an early age with art, acting and music. Radin graduated from Northwestern University in 1996. When his close friend, actor/filmmaker Zach Braff, heard a demo of Radin's song "Winter," he was immediately interested and featured the song on his show Scrubs in the episode "My Screw Up". The song received an overwhelmingly positive response and gave Radin substantial exposure with the show's demographic. The songs "Today," "Closer," "Don't Look Away," and "These Photographs" were also used on the show. Braff also played the triangle in Radin's song "Today." <br><br>
Since then, Radin's songs have been featured on the FOX television drama North Shore, and the ABC medical drama Grey's Anatomy. His song "Closer" appeared in Grey's Anatomy season 2, episode 5 "Bring the Pain", "The Fear You Won't Fall" appeared in season 2, episode 22 "The Name of the Game", and his song "Sky" with Ingrid Michaelson appeared in season 4, episode 15 "Losing My Mind". His song "Star Mile" is on The Last Kiss movie soundtrack. His song "What If You" was featured on soundtrack to the movie Catch and Release." Recently, his song "The One You Knew" was featured in an episode of ABC's Eli Stone. <br><br>
Radin's first-full length album We Were Here was released in 2006. The album is made up of heavily acoustic indie folk/pop, and is especially reminiscent of Simon &amp; Garfunkel, Elliott Smith, Damien Rice and Iron &amp; Wine. His song "Everything'll Be Alright (Will's Lullabye)" makes reference to Hurricane Katrina. He has also stated at live shows that the song "Someone Else's Life" was written for his then-girlfriend and former touring partner Schuyler Fisk. <br><br>
