## 歌词

<div>
pretty ,you know you're so pretty <br><br>
but when you stand in your mirror <br><br>
i know it's not me fear,<br><br>
you got lots of fear but when you <br><br>
hide in your fear you know <br><br>
i don't care i don't really wanna be <br><br>
me don't wanna think of your society <br><br>
i don't really wanna be me <br><br>
i don't want my destiny pretty ,<br><br>
you know you're so pretty but <br><br>
when you stand in your mirror <br><br>
i know it's not me i don't wanna <br><br>
live this life i wish i was another one and they give lies, <br><br>
they give lies i don't really wanna be<br><br>
me don't wanna think of your society <br><br>
i don't really wanna be me <br><br>
i don't want my destiny is this the future <br><br>
i ever dreamed is this the world <br><br>
i ever trusted in now give me a reason,<br><br>
give me a reason i don't really wanna be me <br><br>
don't wanna think of your society <br><br>
i don't really wanna be me <br><br>
i don't want my destiny
